How much smaller depends on what you're making with it - all of the blanket strips I made with this yarn were over 2\" shorter than the ones I made with my other white yarn of the same listed gauge.\n\nDo not use any acrylic/synthetic yarns to make pot-holders and the like - being a plastic-based yarn, they WILL melt when exposed to heat.\n\nStill a great product!

I made a large amigurumi piece and realized 2/3 of the way through that I needed more. New ball matched the old because there’s no dye lot discrepancy. Super Saver will never be the softest or the most stunning, but it has its place and it does what it does well. I wanted bright color, nice (not rough) texture, visible stitches, workability, and sturdiness for stuffing and stitching. Would buy again and I recommend it to everyone as their first practice yarn. Can’t beat it for that.",

        "content": "The three pack is wrapped in plastic keeping it safe from stains. I have 48 years of crochet experience. Red Heart Super Saver is a good all purpose newbie friendly yarn. It is worster weight (4). I have used this yarn for afghans, ponchos, cloaks, placemats Christmas Stockings and shawls. This is economy acrylic yarn. It does feel rough when new but after a few washes it gets softer and softer with use. I have a floor length hooded cloak I made 30 years ago. This yarn is very durable. It is also easy care for anyone who doesn't want to fuss with hand washing and blocking. This yarn is no dye lot. Sometimes no dye lot yarn can change shades but not Red Heart Super Saver. It is rare if it does. I usually use a F or G hook with this weight. If you are new, making something that needs to withstand wear and tear or not sure how much you need, this is a great choice. If you are just learning get a light solid color to practice. If you are worried about how much yarn you need, you can buy more of this later and it should match the shade of your project. Normally 6 to 8 skeins will make a decent sized afghan. At the price listed for the 3 pack it is like a buy 2 get 1 free! This is not a good choice for baby items or warmer climates. It is awesome for New England winters. My only concern ordering online is I am a pull from the middle of the skein person. In a store I usually check for the yarn end pulling from the middle. I am happy to write that all three skeins I received have the end in the middle available which will help reduce yarn barf! Will purchase more of this yarn as needed.",

        "content": "Works for internet but setup can be a little troublesome. So I had trouble following along in the app. You need internet access to set up. I had to reconnect my old modem to get registered. After that I connected this refurbished modem. I got as far as a reset signal was sent, waited 10 minutes. I then believed it was not working. Had 2 blue lights and 2 lights that seemed to be off or at least not green. The app will guide you along and get you connected to your internet provider via phone, that at least was a help. I got through to Spectrum and had a 2 minute wait. Be nice and explain simply, I said I bought a new modem to replace old modem. She verified my address, asked for the old mac id, then the new mac id. Next she said modem would reset which it did. At first I get one at a time up to 4 green lights, then the transmit and receive turned bright blue which makes it appear that the power and network light are off. This is what confused me. Over the next couple of hours I waited, unplugged and replugged modem a couple times, still same thing. After a search on the internet, yes i'm now connected. I found on several forums, or faq on manufacturer site that some units the lights will appear to be off. If you look through the open grill case, i can see inside that they appear green, blue, blue and green, yet on the outside I only see 2 bright blue. The lights are like flood light when they need to be accent lights. I also had trouble loging into the webpage for admin access to modem, gotta use your browser for this. I ended up doing a factory reset with paperclip into the hole on the back, after that I could get in. use admin and the last 8 digits of the serial number on bottom of modem to access. Nothing much in there I need to change, but i alays like to look around. I finished the setup in the app, which now is mostly useless. It only tells me the serial number and mac id and has a copy of spec sheet and manual. Nothing else. It would be nice if the app showed you the status (and allowed turn off of lights) and allowed you to login to the admin settings within the app instead of having to use a web browser. app is kinda lame and the setup procedure although was partially helpful not the best experience. I was excited to get a new modem with an app, but i doubt if I ever use the app again.\n\nThis still is a good choice. My old modem was bought 11 years go when speed was like 20Mbps. It had room to grow up to 150MBps. Spectrum increased to 200Mbps but that old modem was only giving me 125Mbps. Only ended up costing me like 7.67 a year to own vs renting which i'm sure is more than that. I decided it was time to upgrade even though it was still working.\n\nThis modem has room to allow for growth over the coming years. I'm now getting 233Mbps which is far below it's max rating of 1000Mbps. This is fine for video streaming movies and I have lots of smart lights and home control devices along with alexa for voice control. The new speed while not necessary does help. I notice some apps load data faster.",

        "content": "I have Optimum Online (a.k.a. Altice, a.k.a. Cablevision) 500mbps broadband Internet to my home. I keep wanting to switch to Verizon FiOS, but every time I call Optimum to cancel they lower the price of my service. I figure in about 4 more years they'll be paying me to stay. Lol. Which is okay with me, because as bad as Optimum's tech support is, Verizon's billing department is worse. But I digress.\n\nThe product I received is virtually indistinguishable from new. The modem, the power supply (a 12V/1A wall wart), the box, even the documentation looks factory fresh, without a scratch, smudge or hint of dust. The only giveaway is a small \"REFURBISHED\" sticker on the back of the modem, and a lithographed \"Refurbished Unit\" sub-header under the Arris logo on the top of the box. I removed the Optimum-supplied Ubee WiFi gateway, plugged-in the Arris SB8200 and, from my phone, initiated a chat session with Optimum's tech support to provision the new modem. It took a total of around 30 minutes for the tech to finish provisioning the modem, but then I was up and running with speeds equal or even better than I had before.\n\nTwo things to note with the SB8200: 1.) it will only communicate with the device plugged-in to the LAN jack when it was rebooted; if you swap devices you need to reboot the modem to get back on the Internet, and 2.) Optimum provides only \"best effort\" technical support, and no warranty/repair services, for modems purchased from a third party. This applies whether the modem was bought new or refurbished.\n\nI wanted to replace the Optimum-supplied Ubee WiFi gateway with simple modem because I run my own firewall (pfSense), switches (TP-Link Omada) and WiFi AP's (also TP-Link Omada). The Ubee was fine when set in bridge mode (disabling its router/firewall functions) but the Ubee's (extremely strong!) WiFi radios could not be turned-off, and that was interfering with my own AP's signals. Plus, by returning Optimum's gateway and using my own modem I'll save $10 a month, so this refurbished SB8200 will pay for itself in less than a year.",

Connection wise all you do is unplug your old modem from the wall outlet, disconnect the ethernet cable that runs to the router, and disconnect the coaxial cable that runs from the wall. Now all I had to do was shut off the power to my router before connecting the coaxial cable, ethernet, and power to the new modem. Next I had to call my ISP to have them provision the new modem (you give them the MAC address from the sticker on the modem). There's no need to follow the instructions that come with the modem and definitely no need to download the Arris App. Anyways, after a couple of minutes I was up and running with no problems. All in all, happy with a refurbished Arris modem. I upgraded from an Arris Modem that I have been using for the last five years with no problems. Additionally, the unit I received looks brand new and the only way to tell that it is refurbished is because there's a tiny sticker on the back that says refurbished. Lastly, the modem works fine with my slightly random internet service provider known as Vyve, so this modem should work with anyone.",

However cables bandwidth increase with price staying flat so my parents wanted to switch back. Order this modem because it is compatible with xfinity and is good for downloading speeds faster than the plan my parents got 600mbps and they wouldn't be spending money every month renting a cable modem. Xfinity sent a technician to reconnect the house cable and set up the cable modem. The technician informed my parents the cable modem I bought couldn't be recognized by Xfinity and wouldn't work. Luckily I had another arris cable modem a bit slower than this one but I knew it worked since it was the one I just replaced at my house with a faster one. Later that week I went over to my parents house and using the Xfinity app was able to get the Arris SB8200 rb working with the cable and the connection is pulling about 850mbps. I believe the technician was messing up the Mac address when calling in the cable modem. The address had Bs that looked like 8s. After getting modem running I couldn't be happier.",

        "content": "These are my first real pair of binos. I got these as a surprise gift for my wife for our trip to the Everglades. Apparently there are lots of birds there lol. She like birds. Me, eh…not my bag so much. Compared to the gift shop binos at the national park, these are amazing.\n\nThe optics are razor sharp. They are as sharp as the pictures taken from my mirrorless camera lenses costing 8x as much. I was surprised at the clarity and sharpness. The first thought that ran through my head was I need to get a longer range pair but I snapped back to reality. The 8x28 is perfect. I think the next size up would have too much “shake” making it harder to zero in on the object. She would complain and I’d never hear the end of it. Ugh. These can “shake” a little but it’s not that noticeable, as others have mentioned. The distance is nice.\n\nThe controls and adjustability are top notch. It stays where you left it.\n\nThe size and weight is very manageable. It’s not too heavy so you can carry this around all day and it won’t hurt your neck.\n\nIt comes with a nice case that includes a shoulder strap for the case and a neck strap for the binos. Incidentally, the rubber eye cover loop is not broken, it is split by design. That is so you can remove the rubber cover and still have it attached to the neck strap on one side. Otherwise, it would be hard to use with the rubber cap attached to both sides of the neck strap.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about it…\nThe rubber eye covers, the eye side, comes off rather easily when you put it in the case. The large side rubber cover also comes off too easily. I wish these snapped on or took a little more force to pull off.\n\nThe metal strap loops are too small. You can only slide a single flat strap through it. So any strap thicker than that won’t fit. I had purchased a OP/TECH strap thinking I could install it but I can’t. It’s wider so it’s more comfortable and usually the included straps are junk-but the included neck strap is okay.\n\nAll in all my experience with the first real pair of binos has been stellar. I’ve purchased a red dot sight from vortex previously and it has been great. Vortex as a company continues to impress me with these binos.",

Come to find out, they weren’t out for delivery as stated on the app. I cancelled the order and lost out on the sightseeing event.\nThe binoculars, after reordering, we’re awesome! High quality and smooth operation. Eye cups, center focus and size were perfect for me. I got the 10X32. Bright and clear, but it was the quality of the product that impressed me. They’re not something you might want for backpacking but they’re small enough to notice the difference from a large pair. They’re the perfect midsized binocular at a very reasonable price. Happy customer for the Vortex binocular but very displeased with the Amazon promise to deliver on time!",

I have a rare eye disease and my vision is going dimmer by the day.\nI have bought a lot of different bulbs but they all did very little to help me see indoors. When I put these in I was surprised at the difference . My rooms are bright as sunshine and it is saving me a lot of headaches from squinting and straining to see clearly. Glad to have them and I am definitely ordering more. My only concern was they needed to be padded better I am surprised they made it through shipping.",

        "content": "Using a KILL-A-WATT meter to compare the coast between this LED and its incandescent equivalent, the savings become evident. The meter measures based on 24 hours or use, but dividing the number by .25 gives you a 6 hr/day cost. When you multiply by the number of bulbs, you truly see the cost/savings. I only have 8 bulbs, but the incandescent cost me $79.05 x .25 = $19.76 per bulb/yr. x 8 bulbs = $158.08/yr. The LED costs $8.64 x .25 = $2.16 per bulb/yr x 8 =$17.28 . A savings of $140.80 over a years time. This is based off my cost of $0.141 per Kilowatt.\nThis is only my savings for my ceiling lighting fixtures which is less than 1/2 of my total fixtures, so changing everything to LED is going to be awesome, assuming these things last as long as they claim.",

When I ran the water it started to twist in sections. Easy fix, I flipped the hose but it's not really needed. I shut off the water to fully straighten it out, than ran the water. The water pressure was good and I really like the color of lime green nice contrast to the turf grass and most lawn colors. I was impressed with the company and how the hose felt sturdy and well-built that I'm buying a water gun from the same company, sometime later next week.\n\nI had damaged my previous metal hose, one of the bolts came undone so I needed a new garden hose. I didn't want any more gimmicks like expanding hoses or metal hoses with seems to get damage easily at the link, not allowing the water to pass. Choose to get a well built hose and found this. Its flexible, works well and good pressure.\n\nUPDATE : 2/14/2023\n\nAfter using it multiple times a week. (new Asiatic Jasmine minima driveway spot) and yard watering weekends. Its sturdy, feels good in the hand and overall I like it and seems so far durable. Its stiff but still more flexible than basic hoses. Makes it easy to pack in a hose holder box I have.",

Below freezing to above freezing causing major water issues in my crawlspace. I needed a heavy duty very pliable hose that could handle cold weather. Thus far this hose has been exceptional. I needed a 5 foot hose that attaches to my sump pump and runs to the outside wall of my crawlspace to attach to my 50 foot hose. This allows me to just attach my long hose without having to keep gong into my crawlspace. With the extreme temperature swings I have to take my longer hose into the house when the temps drop to avoid freezing. Now that I have this hose it's so much easier to just do that from the outside where I have this hose attached with several pipe clamps.\n\nImpressions: Very sturdy. Well made. Stays very pliable. I have had no leaks on both connections. The price is very good as compared to other hoses.\n\nI just bought a second as a backup. I don't think I will need it but I want to be on the safe side. If I flood I can lose my well pump. No regrets thus far. Durability: Time will tell. Regards.",

Usually I bring them inside before a freeze but the weatherman likes to lie every now and then and I don't catch it in time. But even having been frozen several times for the last winter and a half, they're still working perfectly.

After purchasing a few pre-made kits offered here on Amazon, I thought I could put together better components at half the price by buying items in bulk & packaging them myself. Thus, more people could be recipients of items that could serve dual purposes (i.e. wound plastic bobbins with 50 yards of high quality thread - could be used for hand or machine sewing; disc of 40 straight pins doubled as a pin cushion, set of 10 pre-threaded needles in handy plastic case with 2 buttons & 1 safety pin doubled as needle holder & instant repair kit, etc.)\n\nThese were perfect additions to the kits at a very good price - each safety pin that I tried worked well. I used the smallest pin to hold 6 various sizes of pins together.\n\nGreat deal. Nice set & box.",

        "content": "I've had a 8\" diameter dobsonian telescope for about 25 years but wanted a smaller scope I could take camping when I didn't feel like dragging the heavy, 4 foot long one with me. I also wanted one I could use as a spotting scope for birding.\n\nThere are only two things I don't like about this scope. 1) tripod is way to wimpy. Even on a name brand heavier-duty tripod, it's less stable than a dobsonian. The tripod it comes with is barely adequate. It works best if placed on a sturdy table with the legs extended just far enough to make it less tippy. 2) There is some lense flare when looking at Mars, but this is to be expected for this price of scope. There is also some minor purple fringing around the edge of the moon, but the moon looks so gorgeous thru it that you forget to notice.\n\nNow for what I like:\n1) Portability - doesn't kill my back to haul it outside. Sets up in minutes. So easy to take outside, I use it all the time. I'd only haul my big scope out a couple times a year because it was too heavy.\n2) The moon looks so AWESOME thru this scope!!!\n3) Jupiter: you can see several of the moons. I haven't been able to make out any of the color bands as I kinda can with my bigger scope, but that's to be expected due to the size/cost of this one.\n3) Saturn: It's my favorite planet. Even though it looks tiny in this scope, you can see the rings and it's beautiful.\n\nI was able to see the nebula in Orion's sword from the city (I live on the outskirts of Salt Lake City) It was really beautiful on one especially dark night, but most nights it's not dark enough to see it well. I haven't been able to see other nebulas I've looked for. I expect that when I'm able to get away from the city lights I'll be able to see more nebulas and galaxies. (Nebulas and planets thru backyard telescopes don't look like most photos. You don't see the colors. Nebulas look like gray clouds. They can still be beautiful tho).\n\nThe eyepieces feel cheap, very light weight, but are surprisingly good. Better than I expected for the price. They have enough eye relief that They work ok with my eyeglasses, but I prefer to take my glasses off when looking thru the scope.\n\nI haven't tried the digiscoping adapter yet, but I've experimented with a similar one on my other scope. Digiscoping is tricky and often not all you hope it'd be, but you might get some good photos of the moon.\n\nI haven't really tried it as a spotting scope yet, other than to look at some leaves at the top of a tree, and expect it'll be good for that. I'm considering buying a zoom eyepiece for that.\n\nAll in all, I think this is an amazing scope for the price. Too bad the tripod isn't as good as the scope. If you can get a heavier tripod, you'll love this scope, especially if you can find some dark skies. But even from the city, the Moon, Saturn & Jupiter are so amazing thru this scope.",

        "content": "After several decades, I wanted to return to observing the night sky through telescopes. I didn't want to begin with an expensive telescope, so I went with a entry level item. Celestron is one of the most popular telescope makers in the world, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with a telescope from them, which is why I went with the Celestron 70mm Travel Scope DX.\nI was a bit disappointed with the quality of the diagonal, spotting scope, and tripod. After reading some of the reviews though, I was prepared for that. I ordered a replacement diagonal and tripod along with the telescope. I was more concerned with the quality of the scope. I was pleased with the scope itself.\nThe best way to get started is by observing the easier objects. It allows a person to get used to searching the sky, finding the object you're looking for, and enjoying the view. What better subject to begin with than the moon.\nThe above pictures are of the telescope where I was taking terrestrial photos using a SVBONY SV105 camera. The next was the first picture of the moon with the telescope with my Google Pixel and the smart phone adapter that came with the telescope. As you can see, it needs a lunar filter. Thankfully the telescope came with one. The third image is one taken of the moon with the same Google Pixel phone. This one I still didn't use the filter for, because the Google Pixel has the ability to adjust for the brightness of the moon. I just used my phone's photo ability. The final photo is of trees in the distance taken using the 70mm Travel Scope and the SVBONY SV105 camera.",

Cut to an episode of Big bang theory where one of the characters was using a Celestron telescope for an experiment. I saw the brand before but know nothing about quality telescopes; I returned the cheap telescope and paid a $40 difference for this telescope. Just taking it out of the box, I could feel the quality is much higher than the original one I bought. The body is heavy high quality materials, the eyepieces are actually metal as opposed to plastic coated in chrome. As soon as I set it up, I was able to get a clear view, even the cellphone adapter is made of metal. I am looking forward to using this at night seeing what I can see and capture. My only complaints are the quality of the tripod and travel bag are not great but the tripod is slightly better than the one that came with the knockoff. Recommended for beginners to learn on.",

It was super easy to assemble and I was able to view the full moon beautifully. The software is terrific and easy to use.\n\nMy complaints are:\n\nThe tripod is NOT stable and far too short to be useful (I'm 5' 7\"). I nearly turned myself into a pretzel trying to use the scope and then look into the eyepiece. I wound up grabbing a camp chair and sitting so that I didn't throw my back out We're looking in to getting another one.\n\nThe camera attachment is not very easy to use. You have to take your phone out of its case, but no matter how light, it pulls the telescope out of angle and you have to start over again from scratch. I actually held my camera to the eyepiece to get a picture\n\nBecause of this, I gave this 4 stars",

When I try to lock position in place it always moves because the telescope is a bit too heavy for it. So I’m likely going to upgrade to a better tripod.\nThe iPhone mount attachement is also useless because it’s heavier than the scope. So again locking an image into place after finding it in the focusing scope is impossible.\n\nSo some updates are needed to use the telescope. But it’s a great one for beginnners. I tried another Celestron a bit more advanced. It made finding and focusing much much easier and smoother. But the item was bulky and heavy.\n\nSo I prefer this one just for its compactness and ease of use. Price evens out to the other more expensive one after the add ons.",

Now I wish I had gotten one of these when they were little. So if your kids are little. I would highly recommend getting a Celestron telescope for beginners..

My son is 8 and he enjoyed using it and caught on to the basics of it quickly.\nThe backpack makes it super easy to just pack in the car and take it with us to the park and even on vacation to the beach.\nGreat quality, easy to use, h highly recommend.",

        "content": "I've always loved Sharpies, namely, the ultra-fine and fine point types. On some surfaces, the stuff you write/mark needs to be allowed to dry for a fairly short amount of time or else you can smear it and then not be able to undo the smeared/messed up part, but on some surfaces it's set right away. Either way, once it's set, it stays that way. I have stuff I wrote I've written on with a Sharpie many years, even decades ago, that's still good as new or maybe only with a little wear. Of course, I'm not talking about just writing on paper, in which case you'd obviously expect that. But I'm talking about surfaces such as rubber or certain types of plastic that you can't or can't easily or clearly write on with \"normal\" pens at all: those were easy to use a Sharpie on and what I wrote or drew on those surfaces stays there for as long as I'd ever need (probably until after I die, after decades of being very useful and reliable!).\n\nI also haven't had any of these leak on me, as I've had many normal ink pens do over the years, sometimes ruining something like a shirt I liked a lot. No Sharpie has ever done that to me, though, I'm happy to say! I've also packed these in suitcases during not only more local, but also during long international flights, when the flying altitude is quite high and at least sometimes, I assume the baggage compartments were not pressurized. Yet, they've always survived well, never rupturing or even leaking. Maybe I've just been lucky, but if that's the case, then I've been lucky countless times and feel very safe with Sharpie products, as well as feeling like if any ink pen is going to write on a surface (without being a \"paint\" type pen that's much more expensive and usually unnecessary), then these will do the job, and last long enough to make me feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that in this case, \"name brand\" status can really make a difference, and for very, very little money (spending a few more cents for Sharpies than a budget brand isn't like buying a Rolex!). It might be easy to forget about this if you're looking for a bargain on a minor item like markers, so I thought this worth mentioning here, even though I've never mentioned this factor in any previous review of anything else. Maybe it's partially because you can have the best name-brand item for such little investment when you're talking about markers. But mostly, it's because the Sharpie is so well-known, and for so many decades, in many professions as being THE \"professional\" marker (the only one, really), one that any/every TRUE pro in that given profession uses without exception. In fact, people in my past line of work never asked for a marker. No matter what company or client was involved, no matter where we were on a cross-country tour (at least in the USA, but maybe also elsewhere: I'm just not qualified to say for sure what the case is in other countries), everyone always just said, \"Hey, do you have a Sharpie?\" or \"I need a Sharpie, please.\" Sharpie was equivalent to the word \"marker,\" but was used instead as the most natural, normal thing to say instead of marker, which just goes to show how much it's the accepted standard that, when violated, stands out. That is, if someone asks for a Sharpie (meaning, marker), and you hand them something else, they WILL notice that it's not the normal, high-quality marker they expected.\n\nSharpies are the gold standard in multiple business worlds, I know, but the one I happened to work in had me doing production and/or tour management within various popular music genres (e.g., various types of \"rock,\" pop, etc.). Working in various roles in the music business, many times I found myself playing roles in which I would need to be able to provide a marker to an artist (musician) so they could use it give their autograph to a fan on a very wide variety of potential surfaces that they wanted signed. I always had the production case well-stocked with Sharpies (and if I hadn't, anyone else stocking it would have inevitably and only used Sharpies), not only due to their ability to do the job and do so reliably no matter what odd things fans wanted signed, and no matter what varied surfaces the production crew might need to write upon, but also, to be honest even though it's unpopular to admit you do something due to wanting to present a certain \"image,\" because it was the ONLY pen that a true \"pro\" would use.\n\nWhether it was so that fans would know they were dealing with true pros (\"fine point\" are the standard for autographs, or marking on things like boxes, btw), or so that our business associates such as the local production companies (if I was touring) or the touring crew (if I was doing local production) would know they were dealing with the highest caliber on our end as well. Like anyone taking their career and careers of those they work with, as well as their organization's success seriously, I'm sure you want to be seen as a pro for various reasons, including letting those you do business with, your customers/clients, those who you buy from, etc. feel confident that in working with you, they're working with true pros at the top of their game, providing the best products or services available in your field. It instills confidence on others' part when they see you using the gold standard tools, and in the case of permanent markers, that happens to be Sharpies. Using any other brand just doesn't say \"I'm a pro\" like a Sharpie does. And worse, it can make it seem like you're a \"wannabe,\" someone who's just very new in your field and unaware of how things work, or possibly even a failure, who cares more for saving just a piddly few bucks or cents than for providing the best quality available of whatever you provide. It's not even about the pens when it comes to this issue, of course. But the impression you give off about yourself can be affected by something that's seemingly (but not really) so insignificant as the brand of marker you use. That's not true about what paper brand of staples or paper you use, imo. I'm not saying every single thing matters like this. But for whatever reason, Sharpies have long been the default marker that pros use, possibly in your field as well. And your overall presentation of yourself and your business to any who see that pen, even if you're not actually using it, can translate into more than enough additional dollars you make as a result of being seen as a reliable pro as you could possibly save buying any other brand, as odd as that seems hearing myself write these words (normally, I don't think this way, and I wouldn't say this about most stuff I'd use in my business activities).\n\nBut it's also the case that, in my experience (and I have occasionally used other brands of markers that other people gave me to use), Sharpies are as good as or better than any other marker I've ever used. As should be the case, \"image\" doesn't have to matter here: if you just want the best, most reliable permanent marker out there, you'd get a Sharpie anyway.\n\nAnd btw, no, I do not have ANY investments in the Sharpie company, if that's what they're called, or any other possible personal benefit in recommending these pens!",

        "content": "If you’re looking for cheap pens these are good. They write smoothly and I like the feel. Two big problems I saw with them (but again, you kind of get what you pay for):\n\nThey run out of ink pretty fast. I’ve been a little disappointed with how fast I run through the ink. I write a bit, but not an abnormal amount. Really just in my journal every day, and usually only a few pages at most (small 5x7-ish sized notebook). But luckily the package is large, so I’m not too worried about that. Just may.l not be the most cost-effective option if you’re buying for an office or other environment where you will be writing a lot.\n\nThe other thing I haven’t loved is the speed that the ink leaves the pen. If I’m just writing it seems to work fairly well, with only a few letters here and there coming out slightly faded. But if you try to draw a line (I usually put a line between journal entries so I can maximize page usage… because I use my journals a lot), it fades halfway across my page (again, it’s only like 4-5” across…). So not super ideal for anything more than regular text writing or something along those lines. Any continuous lines tend to run out of ink and you have the lift the pen and start again. Maybe a weird complaint, but I know people who use these types of pens for art and other things like that - so I would not recommend these for that.\n\nOverall, even with these complaints, I feel like for the price, these are pretty good pens. I’ve liked them and it was nice to get so many in a package.",

She can climb all the way up the ladder and go down by herself which I was not expecting.\n\nOne thing to note: THIS DOES NOT FOLD UP. This isn't a problem for me, I don't regret buying the slide, but one of the photos posted makes it look like the slide folds in half for easy storage.\n\nUnless I'm missing something, I do not believe you can store this flat like the picture without removing the slide from the ladder. I don't personally think I could take them apart now that they've been locked into place without risking hurting the plastic.\n\nI definitely recommend this. It's lightweight enough to carry easily but feels very solid. It was wonderful to see my child having so much fun! But like I said, you cannot fold for storage! Not without taking it apart again. And if you've ever assembled something like this, you know they are not built for those plastic notches to come out of their holes easily.\n\nI think how much fun it brings is worth giving up the floor space, especially if the weather outside isn't hospitable where you live right now. Whenever she outgrows this, I am going to hang onto it for someone else who has kids or my grandkids.",

Perfect height and let’s them test themself in the beginning and learn coordinated climb in a safe way especially if you are there with them until they get the hang of it.

I have done professional hvac and refrigeration, as one of my certified trades. I opened the box and inspected the unit, perfect condition! I I allowed it to stand for 24 hours, before starting it, to allow any bit of oil & refrigerant time to settle back into the compressor. Upon start up, it was so quiet that I actually laid my hand on the compressor, to make sure that it was running! Set the thermostat at 5, the highest setting, to cool the fridge before putting anything in it. After 3 hours, the freezer was at 9° and the fridge at 33°! I reset the thermostat at 3 1/2 zone and loaded my food. The freezer now stays at 28° and the fridge at 38° and maintaining. So I'm definitely a happy camper!",

I have used multiple carpet cleaners over the years and IMO the concentrated cleaner you use is very important. Though the Bissell cleaner works fine, I have found 5 guys upholstery cleaner and Oreck are the best I have used so far.\nThe primary reason I write this review is concerning the sprayer. Obviously the sprayer should spray in a fan like design and not squirt. Mine began to squirt two streams. One on each side. After reading questions and reviews I found that this was not uncommon with many returning the unit. I looked closely at my spray nozzle and saw a very tiny white spec in the center. At first I thought this must be part of the design. I then took a toothpick and flicked it out. The spray function then fanned as it should have in the first place. I figured the white spec must have been a remnant from the manufacture of the solution tub. Anyway, the unit works fine now. This is just my second day using it and I have a lot of square feet of upholstery, carpet and yes carpeted ceiling to clean so I will try and update this review once I am done.",

Could probably use some extra padding because they leave red marks on my wrists, but I am also just getting used to using them. I used to just bust my hands doing heavy work, thinking straps were unnecessary, but now I realize I've been leaving weight on the table by NOT having them - quite a bit of weight. So as I learn and adjust maybe I'll find a sweet spot where they are more comfortable. For now, I will keep enjoying their major benefits over their minor detriments. They feel secure in use, don't slip, and really lessen the amount of raw grip force needed to maintain control over heavy cable stacks or trap bars.\n\nToo soon to know how durable they'll be, but aside from some sweat stains they're still looking fresh after 2 months. Nobody else at my gym seems to use straps, at least at the times I work out, so I don't have other sets to compare to.",

        "content": "I LOVE my Instant Pot! But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (\"Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!\"), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well, yeah. So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!) Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for. Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle? Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to? Things like that.\n\nSo, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life: incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes.\n\nFirst, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said \"almost\", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out). The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise. The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that). The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up. Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out.\n\nThe sauté function has three temperature settings: 'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit)\n\nFor pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively). So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons).\n\nThe preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure). That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low). However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button). Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want.\n\nAfter you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word \"on\". Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown. This is *normal*. The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure.\n\nThe cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total. So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really \"dropping in\", but you get the point). And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release.\n\nAll Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms: natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR). What these mean is simply either \"let the pressure dissipate on its own\" (natural pressure release), or \"force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release). The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure. A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)). On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time.\n\nNatural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes.\n\nQuick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!! Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance).\n\nFinally, in my experience, unless you are doing a \"dump everything in at once and turn it on\" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking. For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start.\n\nOh, wait, *this* is actually the final note: the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little \"stains\" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think \"Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?\" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the \"imprints\" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my \"Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot\" post).\n\nOk, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot.\n\nOh, actually there's one more thing. I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*! Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*. For up to 10 hours! You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you! Booyah! (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand. You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.)\n\nNow, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot.\n\nYou definitely will want  this steamer basket  for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes). Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket.\n\nOr, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get  this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set . The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile.\n\nPersonally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try your hand. Pot-in-pot (or \"PIP\") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot. There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from \"I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal\" to \"I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot\" to \"I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time).\n\nFor pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches). Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass.\n\nIf you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this stainless steel  pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them.\n\nYou will also want this separate  glass lid  that is sold by the Instant Pot people. This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there. Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot. Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it.\n\nIn terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books. Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception:\n\nPressure Cooker Perfection\n\nI also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!):\n\nVegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes\n\nAnd if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one:\n\nO M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free\n\n..and this one:\n\nVegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker\n\nAnd speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes.\n\nPoached Eggs: Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil. Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt). Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes. 2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude.\n\nBaked Potatoes: Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes? And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~) Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours! Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer. Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure. Then walk away! Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.! This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes!\n\nHappy Instant Potting!",

        "content": "There are so many people who say the can't cook, but I swear I'm on a whole new level of not being able to cook. This little appliance helps expand our menu and I Have learned to do so much with it. I will sum up in a nutshell, I love how easy it is and how I throw everything in it comes out done. No stirring and not many messy dishes. I still don't love it for meats (which I don't eat much of anyway), but I think that's just a matter of needing to experiment more with them. I seriously can't believe how many foods can be cooked in here!\n\nWhat got me thinking about the IP was talking to a friend at work who is a firefighter. He works long shifts with mostly men, they can't really cook, but they just buy meat and throw it in here. He swore by it. Then someone else chimed in and said they pressure cook a lot. About a month later it went on sale for Prime Day and I picked it up. I am all of a sudden a much, much better cook! There are so many cookbooks for this, my favorite being  Hip Pressure Cooking: Fast, Fresh, and Flavorful  and there's a wonderful Facebook page where people post their successes and fails, so we can all learn from each other. This whole last month has been wonderful. I'll highlight some things I've tried or heard about:\n\n-Chicken: For the first time every I cooked a whole chicken (see picture of it falling apart). My husband couldn't believe I cooked a whole chicken since I usually buy them at the store already made. It was excellent. I did 6 minutes per pound + 2 minutes. I also cook chicken thighs for dinner about once a week, which I had never cooked before. I do that for 10 minutes with some chicken broth and whichever seasoning sounds good. Ironically enough, I can't get my classic boneless, skinless chicken breasts to turn out, but based on my Facebook group a lot of people have success with them.\n-Pot roast: I tried this once and it didn't work great. It was a very lean, thick cut of meat. I heard that the leaner meats are harder to do. Next time I'll try something different.\n-Eggs: I can hard boil 30 eggs at once!!! I work 12 hour shifts and eat 4 with my lunch and 4 with my dinner. Since I work 4 days in a row I have to hard boil 32 eggs. I used to use my egg cooker and do 7 at a time, which was a pain. Now it's quick and easy!\n-Steel cut oats: Another thing that I never ate before. At one point a couple years ago we tried making them a few times, but it's so annoying having to stir the pot all the time and then half the time I ended up with some crusted on the bottom which was annoying to clean up. Now I use the PIP (pot in the pot) method. I put 1 cup of water in the bottom, then the trivet in, then 1 cup of steel cut oats in a large Pyrex glass dish with 2 1/2 cups of water. I put it on for 10 minutes manual high pressure and walk away. Once the pressure releases and I open it they are perfect! I then divide them up into mason jars and put them in the fridge. At breakfast time I warm them up, add some milk for creaminess and they are perfect. We eat them every single morning now. The only dish I have is the Pyrex bowl and I just rinse the metal pot out since it didn't touch any food.\n-Soups: I had never made soup before this. I have made chicken noodle soup many times and everyone loves it. I HATE how chicken noodle soup always has mushy noodles. Not mine! I cook the noodles to how I like them. I've bene wanting to experiment with more soups, but I'll do that in winter.\n-Yogurt: Another amazing feature. I've made yogurt 3 times and love it. My 2 year old only eats my yogurt. I can make a gallon of organic yogurt for a fraction of the cost of buying it at the store. It takes some patience, but the hands on work part of it is only about 20 minutes. There's a lot of waiting for things to heat, cool, incubate, set. I've finally learned when to start to have each step finish at the right time. Feel free to ask if you have questions.\n-Sides: I found a recipe for a mac and cheese that everyone loves. My daughter and her friends are always begging me for it. The best part? It's only 5 ingredients (pasta, heavy whip, butter, salt and cheese). It also only requires washing a cheese grater and the pot and it only takes 20 minute from start to finish. No hard to pronounce, artificial, food dyed ingredients. I have also mastered spaghetti with meat sauce. Before this I had never once made spaghetti with meat sauce. Now I do it all the time. Again, I only have ONE thing to clean afterwards. If I tried doing with without the IP I would have a pan for the meat, pot for the pasta, strainer. It only takes about 20 minutes start to finish. It can be real simple (meat, jar of sauce, pasta, water) or get really complicated with making your own sauce (even then it's still pretty easy).\n-Veggies: Many veggies can be cooked in here. Delicate ones, like broccoli are harder to do. Con on the cob in here is amazing though. Much quicker than any other method.\n-Deserts: I haven't made a desert yet, but on my Facebook group a ton of people are making cheesecake. I try to keep deserts out of the house and just have them for special treats when we're out. So I haven't tried this. A ton of people in my Facebook group are doing it and they look like they turn out great.\n-Chicken broth: I am not the type of woman who makes chicken broth. My step-mom does that kind of stuff and I look at her like \"why don't you just buy it\". Well, now I am the type of person who makes chicken broth. After throwing a whole chicken in here I take the carcass (I hate that word!) and put it back in with some veggies, set it for 2 hours and it's done! I strain it and then have beautiful, healthy, yummy chicken broth. The first time I did it my husband looked at me like I was cray-cray. Now he helps by saving his bones. There is no better chicken noodle soup that when it's made with homemade broth! Yummy!!!\n-Spaghetti squash: This is one food I accepted that it's harder to make than it's worth, so we hadn't eaten it in years. Not anymore! I put it in for 20 minutes without cutting it. When I opened the pot the squash is intact, but with the skin peeling off. It's easy to cut it in half from there, scoop out the seeds and separate it.\n-Applesauce: Whenever my apples start getting too soft, I peel them, use my little apple slicer and throw them in here with some cinnamon. There are recipes for if you want to add sugar, lemon, honey, ect. I prefer just apples and cinnamon though since it's healthy and natural. My kids love it. 8 minutes on manual with a natural release. I just stir it with a fork and don't even need to blend it. There are small, very soft chunks. I wish I had this when my son was a baby!\n\nThose are a few of them things I've made. I have learned to experiment more. Since I usually don't have to do many dishes with the IP I tend to enjoy experimenting. I have a cookbook I write all of my successes in. My family is constant surprised at how much this has changed how we eat. I usually don't keep appliances out on my counter, but since I use this at least once a day I never put it away. The only downfall is I think there is a learning curve to it. It's a little intimidating at first and requires some trial and error. I was terrified of almost everything the first time I did it. 90% of everything has come out great. I'm learning what I like to cook and don't like to cook in it. I love that when we have a last minute neighborhood get together (it happens a few times a week) I can whip up a pasta dish and veggie real quick.\n\nTips (Added Jan 2017):\n-Recipes generally don't include time to come to pressure. Think of this is the same as your oven warming up or water boiling. After your food goes in the pot it has the pressurize, then the timer starts counting down. You can speed this up but turning on \"saute\" first. It cuts the time more than in half.\n-Instructions have lingo related to you the pressure gets released. First there's natural pressure release (NPR). This is just leaving the pot alone until the pin drops, indicating there's no pressure in the pot. The lid can then be removed safely. Then there's a quick release (QR), which is where you turn the pressure release valve at the far side of the pressure cooker. This takes about a minute and releases a bunch of steam, so you probably don't want this under a cabinet. There is also a chance of some food/fluid coming out, depending on what's in the pot and how full it is. If that happens you can wait for it to do the NPR or you can do short, slow bursts.\n-If you're having problems with getting anything to work check all the parts first. Is the silicone ring in place? Is the pin in place and able to move up and down? Is the valve set to \"sealing\"? Is there enough water/fluid in the pot to pressurize?\n\nNov 2016 update: Well, it's not longer sitting on my counter, but I still use it about 2-3 times a week, which is more than any other appliance. I got over the honeymoon period, where I tried EVERY food in here. Now I know what I like and what I don't like in here and I stick with that. I recommend you get 2-3 good cookbooks with this and start finding fun recipes on Pinterest. I keep adding pictures and things in my review.",

        "content": "This is a 6 month update - Have used the product now for about 6 months and feel it proper to update some of my former comments as I have become more familiar with it's features. (I don't shill for Amazon or InstantPot, this is an independent appraisal)\n\nA lot of 5 star ratings. My initial rating was four stars. After a fair amount of use I decided to upgrade it to five. I really like InstantPot and would recommend it to others. I do a lot of soups and stews, a meal in a bowl; I dislike washing dishes! After many years of cooking for a crowd 3 times a day, my wife does not want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. She is a good cook when in the mood, but is the undisputed speed-queen in fixing a meal. She opens 5 cans, dumps them into a large saucepan, a little water and seasoning; 5 minutes later on High heat - Voila! - almost scorched Dinner. For gals who have cooked over 10,000 meals, this may be just the ticket! I enjoy cooking! My preferred menu utilizes pressure cooking to large extent because I live at 5,000 ft. elevation. A must if you live in Leadville Colo.\n\nMy instant pot occupies a small unused ledge in the corner of the kitchen. Two instant pots together would nicely fill the space. Main reason I bought the InstantPot Duo 60 is the removable Tri-clad bottom mirror-finish all stainless steel liner (looks like chrome), along with the delay and cooking timer auto-shutoff. This sets it apart from old-time swisher type 1st Gen P.C.'s. An added lower pressure setting extends its ability to more tender foods. Tender vegetables and yogurt making features are what differs it from the non-duo 60. I haven't made Yogurt yet, but as a Diabetic, crisp veggies are a priority. Sometime soon I'm gonna try making some Yogurt. I've used it in several different modes, enough to feel comfortable about offering my little opinion. To make a stew, you can brown the meat, pressure cook it until tender, quickly de-pressurize, add some beans or veggies, put on the glass lid, set the timer for 2 or 3 hours and slow cook until done. Eat the meal, put the entire steel pot of leftovers with glass lid, (must be ordered separately), in the fridge for tomorrow or day after, all using a single container using only one very safe, quiet, clean appliance. For Chicken Soup with Matzo Balls I cook a whole chicken on the Poultry setting for 35 minutes and let it depressurize on its own. Still under pressure it actually cooks for another 15 minutes. Remove the Chicken, de-skin and de-bone all those little bones and cartilage. Set the pot outside on top of the Barbecue for a few hours, (when it's cold out), to solidify and remove all but some of the surface layer of fat. Put the shredded chicken pieces back in, add the veggies and seasonings, another 6 minutes low pressure cooking or slow cook 'till done; add the freshly cooked, hot Matzo Balls when serving. Others have said they have purchased an extra liner and glass lid so you can see how that would extend its usability. The liner really is easy to clean. Rinse it out under the hot water, a soapy sponge, re-rinse and set it in the sink basket to dry. It's operation is really quiet and there is not any visible steam whooshing through the air. You could very easily cook on the dining room table, or a small adjacent table. Making a pot of beans outdoors next to the barbecue is easy too.\n\nLack of a 15 lb setting poses a problem for some potential buyers as it does add somewhat to the overall cooking time. Some P.C. reviewers have remarked that is a big problem for them. The actual high pressure setting is 11 psi which drops the cooking temp for 260 to 240 degrees. The low pressure is 7 psi. I'm sure it must add to cooking time, but for me, it is not a consideration. In some instances I find it preferable to use my second electric 15 psi P.C. tucked away in another kitchen corner using my stove to steam some Broccoli, using my Barbeque as a convection oven for a Casserole in the summer so I don't heat up the house, If I have two electric pressure cookers going at once it's getting a big Sunday meal done in even less time! During the week I just nuke leftovers.\n\nInitially, at the start you can program it just about any way you like over a wide range of different settings and presets. After 10 seconds has elapsed, it starts whatever you have programmed and cannot be changed without stopping and resetting it. In my initial review I complained a little about the Manual setting. I have come to realize that a good percentage of negative comments (aside from shipping damage or DOA out of the box) are because the person does not understand the operation of the device. Well... I guess I am no different than anyone else in that I misunderstood the purpose of the Manual Program. Manual is a pressure cook only setting and it allows you to vary the P.C. time. No need to change temp, just time and pressure. If you can't find any of the preset times to suit you. Manual will allow you to choose either pressure, or any time from 1 - 120 minutes. Most will not really need to use Manual, but they added it just in case someone finds it useful I guess. Except for the Rice setting you can use almost any setting any way you want, OR you can do it by the book. You can pretty much do whatever you want. You could cook a Chicken using the Bean/Stew setting. Pssst! there aren't any InstantPot police! Because it has so many settings, it takes a while to find all the various available combinations. I've found combinations that cover all the bases. However It is very easy to just stop the running program and switch to a different program to enter a new or different time, pressure, or temp. It takes maybe ten seconds to do this. The only thing keeping you from thinking outside the box is you. Go crazy! Be creative! No Rules! For most, this probably would never even be an issue. I'm kinda finicky, (just ask my wife). For someone who just wants to have a pot of beef stew ready when they get home, no sweat, Read the manual, you won't encounter any problems, the standard settings will work fine). My initial rating was four stars because I thought I was limited by the presets. It turns out that is not really the case. With the InstantPot you really can do just about anything you want. It's just a matter or re-evaluating how you perceive you are able to use it. At first, the presets seem to be absolutes; they are not. It is all just a matter of perception, a little extra thought, a few more button clicks... or if you find the presets work well, as many reviewers have, you can literally just set it and forget it.\n\nThe even heating of the Tri-Clad bottom of the stainless steel liner is a best feature for me as it greatly reduces, if not in most instances, eliminates entirely any probability of scorching your food. The 3 preset settings seem to work as advertised for the most part. Suppose you are going to cook a thick sauce. The preset temp is often Med. which might be too high. When you first turn it on, with any of the four top LH settings you are able to increase or decrease temperature, time and pressure, Hi-Lo. For something thick, you may choose to change the temp from Med. to Low which should avoid scorching. What I do when slow-cooking, is select Saute and High temp setting to save time in order to get 3 1/2 quarts of soup mix boiling, then stop it, select Slow Cook and reset the time choosing a low and slow temperature to finish cooking. I find the best way to cook pasta is to fill it two-thirds full of water, Select Saute, high temp to get the water boiling furiously, stop and reset temp to Medium to finish cooking the pasta. It might prove quicker to cook pasta on your stove, but you can also do it with the InstantPot, drain the water, add spices, Italian Sausage and/or Meatballs, Marinara Sauce, Slow cook on low heat and keep warm with the glass lid on beside the dining room table for a leisurely, more pleasurable, (second helpings don't get cold), dining experience with friends and family. High temp is what you want when pressure cooking meat or poultry with 1 or 2 inches of water which decreases startup time. Cook for 45 minutes using one and a half inches of water because very little water escapes as steam! Just this minute, as I am writing this, (first review), I paused and went into the kitchen to check up on my 5 1/2 quarts of Cowboy Chile that I am slow-cooking. It was almost out of time. I decided it needed another hour, so I stopped it, shut it off, re-selected Slow Cook medium temp, and reset the time for one more hour. The program would have automatically stopped by itself, gone into Keep Warm mode, so you can re-start to cook it longer, anyhoo it's not a deal-breaker. When slow-cooking on Low, my Chile just gurgles away nicely without any scorching with the pot maxed out to within 1 inch from the top. (DO NOT even think about filling the pot past 2/3 full when pressure cooking!) Once, the pot (stainless steel liner) had been in the freezer half-full of frozen soup. I put the pot liner back in its place, put on the glass lid, turned it on to keep warm for a little over an hour. it fully de-frosted the soup which was nice and warm to boot! Don't know if any one would ever do that, but you can set the keep warm timer for up to 10 hours and forget about it, Swedish Meatballs served warm, Fondue? No danger of overheating or boiling away. I speed up the bean pre-soak by putting the beans in the pot and setting the keep warm for an hour, and then letting them sit overnight. I find this necessary in the High and dry climate of Northern Nevada. Everything I've cooked so far has turned out just the way I wanted it, but not without a little creative fiddling. Every new gadget requires a learning curve. Because of it's many features, practice makes perfect! I give the InstantPot designers credit as most automatic settings work well, automating it for ease of use and safety. Cooking is part Science, but, I think, more Art than Science. I have the glass lid on for attended operation. A more tactile experience in food preparation. When slow-cooking I can check on it from time to time and make little adjustments, e.g. more time, less heat, add more chicken stock, taste it, more Oregano, a little Paprika, It's done when it's done, however long that takes.\n\nMost programs work just fine on full automatic, but some small exceptions may demand more online flexibility. I must admit that I am biased in that I very often combine pressure cooking with slow cooking. I live at 5,000 feet with 10% humidity in July. I store a lot of beans which dry out after 6 months. To slow-cook those beans from scratch takes hours and they still are not done because water boils here at 201 degrees. It is surprising what a difference that makes. In New Orleans beans have much higher moisture content and at 212 degrees are done in an hour or less. I have to use a rapid boil just to make tea. A pressure cooker is the great equalizer, a must at higher altitudes because 15 lbs is 15 lbs pressure inside the pot regardless of altitude. I take a little extra time with my beans by using the low pressure setting. I especially like the delay start, cook, auto shut-off, keep warm features. The cooking timer and auto shut-off is absolutely essential for peace of mind for unattended operation as I have been known to doze off when cooking late at night. Every electric cooking appliance I own, including my Induction Range, is flameless and has a timed shutoff feature. I am retired and have the time, but, for those busy people on the go, the set-it-and-forget-it, ability of the InstantPot may prove it's best feature.\n\nI very much like my InstantPot and have used it 2 or 3 times a week for one-pot meals. Having used it now for almost half a year, (I've got a pot of Navy beans cooking now as I update this review). I would say my initial impression was pretty close. One thing I especially like is I use less pots and pans when I am using the InstantPot, (I dislike washing pots and pans). It has some great features which leads me to believe they are really trying to hit it out of the park with this one. A Canadian Distributor; \"Way to go eh! Makes me want to stand up and sing \"Oh Canada!\"\n\nI guess price/point is the big bugaboo with manufacturers. If they added 15 psi I would fork over a little extra cash to get the \"totally perfect\" all-in-one cooker. They could test market it as their top-of-the-line world-beater Ultra Deluxe 7.6 litre model. I believe people will pay a little more if they know what they are paying for. For those desiring the convenience of an all-in-one cooker, at the price, there is little competition. I think it's a great value. Bottom line is: \"I like it just fine the way it is.\" The InstantPot has earned a permanent place in my kitchen.\n\nW.O",

        "content": "Updated 12/9/2018\nStill going strong, still using the heck out of it. Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef! Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef. The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy. I use red for everyday and blue for sweets. I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below.\nUpdated: 9/26/2017\nI’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese! Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti. Super for soups. I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it.\n\nIt’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period. Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release. Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready. You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then!\n\nThere is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece. I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts. It just takes practice and patience.\n\nI recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot.\n\nI love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work. By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy. Way easier to clean a little bowl too. The recipe for that comes with the IP.\n\nI rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above). If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker. That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though.\n\nNow to some specific tips:\nGetting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest. Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point. It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below.\n\nAccessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order.\n\nI use the  RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket  for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside. Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up. That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though).\n\nI use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot.  Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend.\n\nI resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee). I bought the  Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch  which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware.\n\nTwo last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles. You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine!\n\nThis is a great purchase – you’ll love it!",

        "content": "Over the years, I have purchased hundreds of items from Amazon, and for the most part, got what I expected. I never reviewed any of them. But from the moment I received my Instant Pot, I felt that I had purchased something that not only exceeded my expectations, but will make my life easier (and more delicious)!\n\nI am a holistic nutritionist and a follower of a lower carb/paleo/primal lifestyle (and yes, it is not only a food regimen, but a lifestyle). Many of the meals I prepare require advance planning and preparation, and I am OK with that, realizing that it is an investment in my family's health and wellbeing. I was looking for something that would support my food choices and perhaps make it a little less time-consuming. I have used a crockpot extensively over the past years and while I appreciate the ease of use and the ability to put a meal on the table soon after I got home in the evening, there is that \"everything tastes the same\" factor I was running into with my family.\n\nSo I began thinking about ways to cook my meals faster and realized that a pressure cooker may be the answer. But, I am scared of pressure cookers. Even though my head tells me that people have been using them for many years with no problems, my heart said there was a strong chance I could blow up the entire kitchen, myself included. I had no idea there were electric, programmable pressure cookers out there that would virtually eliminate that worry until I began researching them, first on Amazon, and then on other websites. I eventually purchased the Instant Pot over the others because of the stainless steel insert (no aluminum), the size of the pot (I wanted a larger capacity), and the ease of use.\n\nThe day it arrived, I plugged it in and began reading the manual. The manual was very helpful, even included a suggested trial run to familiarize one with the basics. My first meal was potato soup (I know potatoes are not low carb or paleo, but once in a while you gotta have potato soup). I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was to make this soup that would normally take a couple of hours. I just coarsely chopped the vegetables, threw those in the pot, added the seasonings and the liquid, started the pressure cooker option, and in 20 minutes all I had to do was use my immersion blender to puree the soup, add some cheese, stir and it was ready to eat. AND the soup was every bit as good as my slower version that keeps me tied to the kitchen to stir and monitor until it's done. That is the hidden beauty of this appliance, that while it's cooking your food, you are free to do other things such as harass your kids to get their homework done. No more watching over a pot!\n\nMy second recipe was lemon pepper chicken wings. There is a searing option, so first I browned the wings in a bit of butter, then added lemon pepper, salt, and 2 more tablespoons of butter. Put on the lid, set the pressure cooker for 25 minutes, and out came the most delicious, fall-of-the-bone wings just loaded with flavor. The family went wild!\n\nI also made mushroom gravy (no flour) pork chops in 30 minutes in the pressure cooker - the gravy was so good my son ate in on top of some gluten free noodles the next day for lunch - and a breakfast meat loaf in the slow cooker, also a winner.\n\nI am also using this to reheat food since we don't use the microwave anymore and I'm finding that it seems easier and makes less of a mess than going stovetop.\n\nThat's a pretty long review for a first-timer but I am so enthusiastic about this product that I just had to share.",

        "content": "FURTHER UPDATE - It's now August 2017 and I've had my IP for almost 2.5 years. I got Pork Chile Verde dialed in, using the recipe from Serious Eats. I add a diced fresh jalapeño and some lime juice after cooking to add brightness to the sauce. Perfection! And I tested out the slow cooker with Chow's Slow Cooker Chicken Tacos. It took a mere 2 hours (adjusted to MORE, or high). I use 2 jalapeños in place of the harder-to-find habanero pepper and add 1 tablespoon chili powder. Also perfection. I'm still using my original gasket rings, one for savory foods, one for sweets and both are holding up fine. I've moved my slow cooker and rice cooker to the garage, because I just don't use them anymore. And like most long-time users, I never use the preset programs, because most recipes require a timing adjustment anyway. It's just easier to use the manual button for everything. If you're a fan of split pea soup, you've got to try Kenji's technique from Serious Eats. Saute ham and aromatics until softened, about 3-5 minutes, then add peas and liquid. Cook under pressure for 20 minutes and quick release the pressure. Stir and the peas melt into perfect smoothness. I know, it goes against the warnings, but it works. I've never had any issue with the pressure valve getting clogged or peas spewing out the valve. I used to make this with slow release, but Kenji's method is far superior and takes only 30 minutes, start to finish. Try it! I've also replaced my old favorite steamer basket for one with a handle, the Hartigo steamer basket. It's pricey, but copycats as low as $9.99 are now available. Most of them are probably just as good, search for Hartigo and read the reviews to make sure you're not getting a piece of junk.\n\nFIRST UPDATE - 11 months later, I'm still loving my Instant Pot. This winter I've added my favorite soups to it's repertoire. Senate Bean soup (recipe from Saveur.com) is the best bean soup ever, with only 12 minutes under pressure. For the two of us, I skip the ham hocks and buy a chunk of ham from the deli counter at the supermarket that I cut into half-inch pieces. I replace half the cooking water with low-sodium chicken broth for deeper flavor. Split pea soup is also the easiest ever, cooking in just 10 minutes. I use chicken broth and diced ham in it, too, unless it's January, when I toss in the bone from our Christmas ham. When I don't have any ham at all, I bring out my secret weapons, ham soup base and liquid smoke. All the same flavors, less money! For the holidays I made a pumpkin cheesecake that was sheer heaven. I even made that Bolognese sauce I was planning in my original review and my dude and DIL declared it the best they'd ever tasted. She's bonkers for my refried beans, too.\n\nI routinely use it to make mashed potatoes for two or a crowd. I made them for 11 people at Thanksgiving and for just the two of us last week. I use my steamer basket to hold them. I bought this  RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket  and had my guy remove the handles. Perfect fit! Best thing? Because they sit above the liquid, they absorb less water, which means they taste a lot more like potatoes. Doesn't matter whether I'm cooking 1 potato or 9, it takes 8 minutes and a quick release. On turkey day we riced them right into the liner pot, added half and half, butter and set it to keep warm while we finished up with gravy and getting things out to the table. Baby yukon or red potatoes, cooked whole with skins on, are cooked the same way and are so much better than boiled. Tossed with butter, salt and pepper, they're one of the easiest sides ever. For them I use this  Stainless Steel Steaming Steamer Rack 8.5 Inch Diameter , which is great for things that won't fit in the basket. Best of all, I store both of them right in the Instant Pot along with rack that came with it. A good thing, too, because I've about run out of storage space in my kitchen. Fortunately, I use my IP often enough that it pays to keep it on the counter. My stand mixer, used maybe once a month, has been relegated to a cabinet.\n\nThe next thing I want to conquer is Chile Verde for two. I plan to use boneless country-style pork ribs as a smaller cut alternative to pork butt. I'm still trying to find the perfect recipe that I can adapt to the IP. I continue to be amazed at the things I can cook in one pot, making cleanup a breeze. The convenience, time savings and above all, the taste, keeps me on the lookout for new things to make in it. In fact, every time I read a recipe for a braise of any kind, I mentally begin to rewrite it to work in my IP. Full disclosure, I still haven't used the slow cooker function, because cooking under pressure produces better food than my slow cookers ever have.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - I've had my IP for 3 months. In that time I've used it to make ribs, steel cut oats, my very first ever baked cheesecake (no cracking!), pulled pork (BBQ and Mexican), chile Colorado (wondrous), risotto (yes I did) and beef tips in gravy (so good). That's not all I've made in it, but it's a small sampling.\n\nOther reviewers have gone into great detail about it's features and functions. I'm more into telling you how it fits into my lifestyle. I'm an early retiree, living in Tampa, FL with my husband. Our son, DIL and their 4 young wolves live on the next block and we're often together on the weekends and even some weeknights. I'm a fairly accomplished home cook and cook most things from scratch because they taste better and take only a little longer. I'm all about making the process easier, faster and better. I also HATE standing over a hot stove for a long time. My Instant Pot works well, whether cooking for 2 as I usually do, or feeding the entire wolf pack (that's 8 of us when we're all together).\n\nI don't like to use my oven unless absolutely necessary. By far my most used appliance is my Breville Smart Oven (the big one). It keeps my kitchen much cooler year 'round. I consider slow cookers too hot to use indoors in summer, as running on low all day my kitchen still gets warm, even with a ceiling fan. My Instant Pot is a slow cooker, too, and it doesn't heat up my kitchen at all. It's just better insulated, but I've found that meals are so good under pressure that there's no need to use the slow cooker function. I keep meaning to, but speed always seems to prevail. I love that I can make roasts and other long-cooking things that we used to reserve for cooler months.\n\nOne of my concerns was the ability to cook smaller cuts of meat and smaller volumes of other foods than the recipes indicate. I was assured by my friends at Chowhound.com that this was simple. For meats, I just buy a smaller cut from the same area of the cow or pig. Instead of a pork butt, I use blade steak or boneless country ribs. For chuck roast, I use chuck steak or boneless beef ribs. These things all cook in about 35 minutes.\n\nThis being my first pressure cooker, I had no idea how to use one, and specifically, I'm pretty clueless about cooking times because they're all over the charts, with many cookbooks (I'm looking at you, Great Big Pressure Cooker Cookbook with your 10 minute risotto) being no help at all. Or others which suggest we Increase the stovetop time by 30% for every recipe? Who thought that was the right way to go? My best results have come from the recipes on Serious Eats and Barbara Schieving's website, Pressurecookingtoday.com, using the timing charts on the IP website or hippressurecooking.com. Note that Barbara often lists much longer times for roasts than needed.\n\nAll the things I've made in it? Chile Colorado. I served it cubed the first night, then shredded the leftovers for burritos. Meyer Lemon Cheesecake, Creamy Parmesan Risotto, Lime Cilantro Rice, Pulled Pork, Baked Beans, Weeknight Pot Roast & Potatoes, White Rice (much faster than my rice cooker), Steel Cut Oats, Beef Tips, Pork Carnitas, Refried beans. I like to keep those on hand. I soak pintos overnight in the IP's pot, cook them with a quartered onion and mash them with butter or bacon grease, cumin and chili powder, right in the pot after reserving the liquid. They cost half as much as buying canned beans and taste worlds better. Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender in 30 minutes. It was easy to make a double batch for the wolfpack, chill them overnight and finish on the grill next day. Next week I'm making the classic Bolognese from the ATK book which is only one ingredient away from Marcella Hazan's famous all-day version of the sauce. Total time, 90 minutes instead of 4 hours.\n\nBest things about the Instant Pot, aside from how it makes food taste? It's effortless. Really, push Start and walk away. And the steel inner pot is wonderful. Most things I've made begin with the Sauté setting before going under pressure. We get superior browning before deglazing the pan with liquid. Although the silicone gasket now reeks of chili it hasn't affected anything else. If anyone knows how to remove the smell from it, let me know. Silicone is stubborn that way. I have a 2nd gasket that I use for oatmeal, rice and cheesecake. The gasket is easy to remove and replace. The steel pot goes into the dishwasher. I'm considering getting a nonstick pot for rice and oats. This handy appliance has transformed my summertime cooking, allowing me to break away from our usual salads and grilled chicken rut. Can't wait to see what it does for stews and chilis in winter.",

        "content": "EDITED 06/07/2016: Sadly, I had to ask the manufacturer for a replacement unit, but I am still happy with the product, and am pleased with the manufacturer's customer service response.\n\nWithin two months of using my Instant Pot, I had grown completely dependent upon it for life support. Going back to cooking things on the stove seemed just as preposterous as starting a fire in the middle of my living room and roasting some meat on a spit. Then, tragedy struck. My IP would not come to pressure! Steam leaked constantly from the steam vent, and the countdown would not start. The display just read \"on\" indefinitely. The food would still cook, but the whole process was noisy and smelly. Also, food at the bottom of the pot would burn due the the lack of a tight seal. I carefully checked the steam vent and all the other components, and could find nothing wrong with any of them. I cooked this way six or seven times, putting up with the noisy steam venting, just to see if I could get it to work. Then, the next time I plugged in the IP, all the lights flashed, there were terrible beeping noises, and the display flashed, \"C6.\" I immediately consulted the manual, the website and the Internets, and determined that this seems to be a common problem among IP owners, and that I would need to contact support.\n\nThere are two methods for contacting support, e-mail and their website. I think you may be able to call them on the phone but this is less effective. I created a ticket on the website and waited nervously. They responded in three business days. They asked me to provide the original receipt, a photo of the sticker on the back of the machine, a photo of the C6 error and my mailing address. I provided them the documentation a couple of days later. They quickly responded, and did not ask me any questions or force me to go through any sort of troubleshooting routine. They simply said they would rush mail me a new base right away. I asked about the problem with the steam vent, which preceded the C6 error, and another rep answered within a few minutes that they would also include a new lid in the same box. They also did not say that I had to mail back the first unit.\n\nWithin a few days I received a box via Fed Ex. I live in Hawaii, so shipping anything large via Fed Ex is very expensive for the company. The thick, sturdy outer cardboard box contained an inner box with the IP marketing printed on it. The inner box had tight styrofoam packaging. When Amazon originally mailed me the IP, they did NOT include an outer box but simply sent the thinner inner box through the mail with the shipping label right on it. This new mailing gave me some initial confidence that maybe this unit was not knocked around in transit as much as the first one. Also, the power cord was different. The first unit did not have a removable power cord, whereas this one's plugged into the back of the unit. They also included all the accessories - the sealing ring, rice paddle, drip catcher, steam rack, etc. The only thing that was missing from a brand-new purchase was the stainless steel inner pot. The old one still works fine, however.\n\nSo far, I have only had a chance to test it with water, but the new unit seems to work peachy.\n\nI was initially going to change this to a 4-star review, since it is not acceptable for a product to break after only two months of use. I have two rice cookers, both Tiger brand made in Japan, and the first one has lasted nearly TWENTY YEARS and is still going strong! However, I give IP the benefit of the doubt that the first unit could have been somehow damaged in transit, although it worked fine initially. Also, it was a \"Warehouse Deal\" from Amazon so who knows what happened to it before it embarked upon its journey into my kitchen.\n\nI look forward to getting my (new and improved) life back!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nIs there an option for TEN stars?! I am thrilled with the Instant Pot - it has changed my life and I have not even gotten started yet.\n\nI saw another electric pressure cooker advertised on TV, and it seemed like a miracle based on their glossy video. So I did some research and decided, based on the reviews and features, that I would rather have the Instant Pot than the other brand. However, because I have a very small kitchen that is already crowded with my Vitamix, I was reluctant to add another very large countertop appliance to the mix.\n\nIn the next few months, I was motivated by two cooking disasters involving my oven. Both times, I wanted to make a special Sunday dinner for my guests. The first time I tried to make baby back ribs in the oven. Hours later the ribs were nowhere near cooked, and with great shame I had to pull salmon out of the freezer and try to cook that from frozen instead. Humiliating and exhausting! After I cooked the ribs for hours more, they were way too soft and didn't taste right at all.\n\nNext disaster - a whole chicken. Same story. My guests were waiting while I desperately tried to get the darn bird up to temperature. No luck! Finally I cut the chicken into pieces and shoved it back in the oven. I was able to finally serve it, but everybody practically gave up by then.\n\nI immediately took the plunge and ordered one from Warehouse Deals. It seemed like a decent price and with Prime, items are returnable to Amazon. So I took the risk. The item arrived in its own cardboard box with no outer brown box, and the box was slightly damaged. There was no privacy & everyone in the office knew what I ordered. But no big deal. The problem was - I was a little intimidated about using it at first! In fact, it sat unopened for over a week. However, after I completely read the manual and included cookbook, I found that the operation of the machine was dead easy. The machine and accessories looked like new even though they were marked \"used\" on Warehouse deals.\n\nSo far, I have cooked with varying degrees of success: Corned beef brisket (perfect!), white rice (overcooked twice), black-eyed peas (overcooked in 8 minutes, 10 on warm), boneless chicken thighs (okay), boneless pork ribs (okay), custard cooked directly in Mason jars (overcooked twice), and Thai sticky rice (twice with excellent results).\n\nThe Thai sticky rice was the far and away winner. If you have ever tried to recreate this restaurant staple at home, you know it can be a tricky process. With the Instant Pot, it is so easy you may not even realize you've done any work! However, you do have to plan ahead. Here's how I did it: Purchase Thai sticky rice (I bought it at the local health food store). This is a special variety, so don't try to substitute another type of rice. Soak for 12 hours. Drain and rinse, and place rice inside of any glass bowl that will fit into the Instant Pot. Mold the wet rice around the sides of the bowl so that it is evenly distributed with a hollow in the middle. Place a steam rack over one inch of water in the inner pot. Place the glass bowl on top. Press Manual (high pressure) and set for 12 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Reheat any leftovers by re-steaming inside the Instant Pot for Manual (high pressure) for 5 minutes. Reheating the rice in the microwave may not produce the same results.\n\nRegarding the sealing ring - it definitely retains smells! I had some luck steaming vinegar in the pot but it did not take out all of the strong corned beef smell. I will try some other methods others have suggested. Meanwhile I tried to order an extra ring from Amazon for desserts. The \"Prime\" option was out of stock so I ordered one from Instant Pot as a third-party seller. When I tried to check out, I realized that Instant Pot was going to charge me $60 to ship the ring alone to Hawaii!!!!! No way!!! I found the ring on Walmart.com, and while I was unable to pick it up in the local store, I was able to get free shipping by adding some other needed items to the order. The new ring has not yet arrived.\n\nI have planned out dozens of meals that I can't wait to try in the Instant Pot! Baby-back ribs of course, sweet-sour spareribs, saag paneer, all kinds of curry, etc. Not only was this purchase so worth it, I am kicking myself for not doing this years ago!",

        "content": "UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous \"soccer mom spaghetti\" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P.\n\nTo put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan.\n\nImagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan.\n\nThen you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup.\n\nPasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying?\n\nAnyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer... :)\n\n********\nABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets...\n\n3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too.\n\nInstant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion.\n\nWhere Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from.\n\nHome Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle.\n\nIn short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.",

I had to take off the little white plastic u shaped cup off the back of the unit before it would close right. The instructions does not mention to do that. I thought it had to be on.

Wait until you have used the pot for a week or two, then order only what you feel you need and will use. I quickly learned that getting some foods in and out of the pot can be difficult without tools. Therefore the Steamer Rack Trivet with Handles was my first add-on and the SOLEADER Plate Gripper Compatible With Instant Pot Accessories was my second. Double check that accessories you buy that go in the pot are appropriate for the 3 quart size--no larger than 6 inches diameter. I was pleased to find so many Instant Pot videos on YouTube which helped me get up and going with reduced learning curve and minimal aggravation. While this pot has a Sauté setting, it does not toast or brown foods. I often use it in combination with my Ninja Air Fryer to achieve maximum cooking convenience. I can't imagine using my stove or oven again unless I'm cooking for a crowd.",

I was so happy because i love this machine, so my conclusion is you should not leave it running for long periods, store cubes in ziplock bags and give the machine a break by unplugging it for 24hrs or less, then fill the resevoir to max level and turn on. Also i might add my tap water causes lime easily so i do not use it in the machine, i buy bottled water for it....i hope this is helpful.",

I turn it on when the ziplock bags in the freezer (previously filled with this ice) get low, making sure that the water area is full. Fill a gallon ziplock bag or three, then turn it off. It is great, if you get low on the water or the basket is full, the machine will turn itself off automatically.

Players take turns matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. Special action cards, like Skips, Reverses, Draw Twos, color-changing Wild and Draw Four Wild cards, deliver game-changing moments as they each perform a function to help you defeat your opponents. If you can't make a match, you must draw from the center pile. And when you're down to one card, don't forget to shout \"UNO!\" The first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand wins. Now card game-lovers can get UNO in a sturdy tin that's great for travel and makes storage stress-free. Colors and decorations may vary.",

        "content": "Remember when families and friends actually played board games, and card games? Instead of a living room with no conversation, just a bunch of people tapping and swiping their phones? Well getting this UNO set can help you relive some of the magic from the good old days. When everyone actually had fun and interacted with each other.\n\nBelieve it or not, I forgot how to play UNO. Which is weird, considering how much I played it when I was younger. Even as a young adult. But just like riding a bike, you never really lose it. Open the tin, break out the cards and the rule sheet. And in a minute, it all came back. So easy to play, that even toddlers can participate.\n\nBONUS TIP: HOW TO GET EVEN THE SMALLEST KIDS INVOLVED\n\nSo Mattel recommends that kids ages 7 and up can play. But any kid 4-6 can most likely grasp the basic rules, as long as they can recognize numbers. The catch is that it may not hold the attention of a five year old all that great. But there's a way that you can still put the UNO cards to good use, while enjoying some bonding time with your little ones. Here's what I figured out, after a couple of games of UNO with our Little Girl....\n\nMake it a memory game. What I did was go through the cards, and picked out two identical ones for different numbers/colors. So two green 5 cards. Two red 4 cards. Two blue 2 cards. Two yellow 7 cards. I tried to avoid sixes and nines. Basically take eight to twelve cards in total. Then place them in two to three rows, face down (UNO side up). I'd ask our Daughter to flip a card over. Yellow 7. Okay, now try to find the other Yellow 7. And she gets to flip over another card. If it's not the right one, I let her know that was a really good try. Now let's flip the cards over, and try it again. If she gets it right, I congratulate her, and she gets so excited. This way, she can play a simple game that also helps her work on her memory skills. So she can remember where certain cards were, and match them up. When she does well with six cards, I bump it up to eight cards. Then ten cards. It's simple, but fun for the smaller kids that may lose interest in actually playing UNO. And she still gets to have fun with the rest of us.\n\nThere are no negatives about this set. The only thing that could have possibly been improved, is to have made the tin a tiny bit more travel-friendly. The two stacks of cards are held in plastic, inside of the tin. But it seems like they could have simply made the tin much smaller, and still fit the cards in. Making it a bit easier to just stick in your pocket. That's not a dealbreaker, just thinking out loud. Otherwise, the quality of the cards and tin are both great.\n\nLook. It's ten bucks. That's it. People spend more than that on two iced coffees, or a drive-through at a fast food place. But those are things you only get to enjoy once. Whereas you could use these cards in this tin for well over a decade. Plus you can make it a family tradition, or have fun when friends come over. It's advertised as a kid's game. But truth be told, we played it more in our dorm's game room than I ever did as a child. UNO never gets old. Why put it off? Add it to your shopping cart. You've got the ten bucks to spare, right now. Check out. It will show up at your home in as soon as a day, if you have Prime free shipping. And you can take that ten dollars, and turn it into million dollar memories with your family. But you can't do that, if you don't order it. So buy a set today, you'll be thankful you did.",

Since we play a lot, I figured it was worth it to upgrade from our zip top bag to the nice tin.\n\nThe tin seems sturdy and looks nice, easily stacking on the shelf of games.\n\nBUT the tin has a flimsy cardboard insert that will surely not last long. The cardboard takes up space, making the tin bigger and bulkier than it needs to be. And when the cardboard falls apart, the cards will sit sloppily in the box instead of neatly stacked. Disappointing.\n\nThe game itself is classic UNO and has the newer wild cards with the blank area for house rules.",

Luckily, they have cynical parents who know better, so when this pack popped up, at a fraction of the cost, we decided they were worth the gamble, if only to give the kiddos a small treat during the holidays.\n\nTwo kiddos, to bundles purchased. One bundle had zero repeats, while the other pretty much had nothing but repeats. I was tempted to return them, but figure they could each get on of the doubles, and the others can be traded away. Or as these cynical parents guessed, cards ended up being tossed into the bin a couple day's later.\n\nOverall, price per card wasn't bad. We may or may not purchase more bundles.

I bought a little zip lock pocket for the cards to go in and created a foldable bag tag/header.\n\nMy plan is to include two cards per bag for his class of 19 with a few cards left over. I was skeptical about these since a few people said they got like two different cards (40 of one and like 10 of the other). I was fully prepared to get like 25 and 25 and that would have been fine honestly since I only needed two diff cards for each kid. I was a bit worried about getting all energy cards, but that can happen with a regular booster pack too.\n\nMy pack came in pretty quickly and I had very few duplicates. If this was for a child just starting their collection, I think this would be a good set. My son already has most, perhaps all, of the Pokécards we got in this pack, so I can’t recommend it for deck building.\n\nI received 51 cards total. 4 energy cards (all different), 8 trainer cards (all different), 2 Treecko, 3 Voltorb, 2 Gulpin, and one of each of the following:\nSneasel\nSeedot\nMinior\nVolbeat\nRattata\nTeddiursa\nWhismur\nPhanpy\nWingull\nTropius\nLarvitar\nMarshtomp\nSurskit\nZorua\nMareep\nEevee\nCutiefly\nBeaviary\nTentacool\nTentacruel\nCacturne\nLombre\nNuzleaf\nShelgon\nBoldore\nWoobat\nTurtonator\nPignite\nBouffalant\nHerdier\nPyroar\nSlakoth\n\nAll in all this works well for what I purchased them for.

    "description": "Product Description\n\nTo kill common household ants, simply place TERRO Liquid Ant Baits stations near indoor areas where ants are spotted. Ants enter the trap, consume the liquid ant bait and return to the nest where they pass on the bait to the rest of the colony. TERRO Liquid Ant Baits are specifically formulated to allow worker ants to consume the product and survive long enough to carry the liquid back to the nest and deliver a dose to the rest of the colony . The liquid ant bait stations prevent the bait from drying out and provide the ants with a continuous supply of liquid, day and night. Monitor the baits regularly for activity, but do not interfere with the ants or baits. Replace with additional baits when the first set is depleted. Depending on the size of the ant infestation, complete control may take up to two weeks.\n\nRecommended Placement : Along baseboards In corners of rooms and cabinets On countertops Under and behind appliances Under sinks or around pipes and water sources On windowsills and around doorways Near garbage cans Along ant trails.",

        "content": "I very rarely write reviews which is kind of stupid because I usually read reviews prior to getting certain products. Therefore I guess I will start now, hoping I can help someone decide wether or not this product is for them. Before you read this long review I want to let you know this is the BEST product I have ever used.\n\nBefore I tell you about how AMAZING this product was I will tell you what kind of Ant 🐜 problem I had. Maybe someone can relate.\nI have a parrot and he is in a room that is near a window. With all the different types of food he eats and with the warmer weather that we started having in my area (NJ) I started seeing ants outside. That’s when I started seeing some ants coming in from the bottom left corner of the frame of our window. I have never had an ant issue with the 17 years I live hear. Even having my parrot and all the amounts of food he eats. For some reason last year during the spring time is when I saw these crazy little annoying bugs come in my house.\nThese ants seemed to be a different type of ant. One I have never seen before. They were small but the minute you go near them they would run away or scatter away super fast. I have an exterminator on my block and he told us they were sugar ants. What the hell is a sugar ant? Lol. Well I was told that these ants hide out in your shower and in the kitchen because of the sugary foods around. Why are they found in a bathroom is beyond me. But I looked it up after what he said and everything he told us was what I read on line about “sugar ants”. I mentioned that last year I had this problem and they were found behind the faucet in our shower. That’s another story. Anyway, before having an exterminator come into my house, I figured I would try to resolve the problem myself. So before buying this “AMAZING PRODUCT”, I purchased all the “Raid” products that come in the square plastic containers. The ones that come in white or grey containers. I put the Raid traps by the window and where else I thought they might come in. I actually tried the mixture of vinegar, sugar and water concoction that was told on line to use for these ants. But nothing worked. I doubt an ant even went to these traps because near my window they would go around those traps. I was getting frustrated because I skeeve bugs. And I was afraid of an exterminator coming in with my parrot living here. I wasn’t taken that chance of him dying with the chemicals. Anyway after coming to a dead end with the Raid traps I began reading and reading on so many products just to find a worthy product. That’s when I came across this product. It was very different than the normal products that are used to kill ants. So I figured why not, let me give it a try. I received my order really fast and was anxious to use them. After reading all the directions these baits were very easy to use. It comes in a thick clear rectangular container. To open it, it Reccomended to hold it up right and twist off the plastic top until it snaps off. It was a little tough for me to snap off the top like it says on the package. Therefore I used a pair of scissors to open the trap. Word of advise, if you need a pair of scissors to open your product, just make sure to keep the trap upright so the liquid doesn’t pour out. After opening the trap, I then placed this trap about 3-4 inches away from the bottom corner of the window. Right where I saw the ants coming in. They scurried away from me at first, but the minute I put this trap down it was shocking!! No joke. I was shocked to see all these ants go running toward the opening of this trap. The trap actually attracted more ants to come out of hiding to eat this food (crazy). I actually spilt a little bit on my windowsill and some ran to that and got stuck. But what was amazing to me was after I put the trap down and watching these ants go to it, it was shocking to see them run right back out of the corner of the windowsill. It was crazy. I just watched for a few minutes and to see them either get trapped inside the trap or grab some of the food in the trap and run back outside or wherever they came from. And by the end of the day they were gone. It’s about 2 weeks now since I only used one trap and I have yet to see another NASTY ANT!! Wahooo!!!! They are gone.\n\nThis product is BY FAR THE BEST ANT PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!! This is noooo joke. Therefore you can count on me to continue to purchase and use this product for any ant problem that might arise again. I will never buy a different type of ant trap again. No matter how popular people feel the “Raid” products might be. The sprays are only wonderful for the outdoors but for the inside the “Raid” products are definitely not as effective as this product is. I actually gave my neighbor 2 traps and after a day or two they were gone by him as well. These traps are crazy how wonderful they work. I swear by this product and I know if you purchase these traps you will too. I will never buy another kind of ant traps again. These are the BEST kind of ant traps on the market by far!!! And mind you, I AM NOT making any kind of commission from this company for this product review. I am just sooo happy my ant issue is gone for now. Sooo, if you want to get rid of these annoying, nasty bugs “FAST,” then purchase these traps. And I promise you, you will be so happy you did.",

We have indoor dogs, plus, we prepare food in this area and we did NOT want to use chemical pesticides.\n\nFirst I tried diatomaceous earth and it did not work. We tried spraying the ant trail with household spray cleaners, cleaned them up, then followed up a 2nd time to try to clean up any scent trail. The ants simply changed course and found different ways in. There must have been hundreds or thousands of ants that were coming from a huge colony in the backyard.\n\nAfter doing some research, I found these traps are pretty safe. The low dosage of borax in the traps really won't really harm dogs or humans. Borax is non-toxic to humans to begin with, unless consumed in large quantity.\n\nI placed just a couple of these bait traps on the kitchen counter, out of reach of the dogs. I also placed just one outside where the trail was, and made sure the dogs could not get to it. The ants quickly made their way into the bait traps. Within just 24 hours, there were hardly any ants seen at all. Within 48 hours, not a single ant was seen in the kitchen. The ant trail outside was also gone.\n\nThis product worked amazingly well. Just BE CAREFUL not to tip the trap forward after cutting off the tab or the liquid will start spilling out. The slightest tip forward will make this leak.",

        "content": "These work well. Through some Google-research (I call it gee-search) I discovered that ants can't really be avoided through spraying (like what professional service companies advertise), so these perform the function of creating a \"bait-trap\" that the ants consume and either die or carry back to their colony (I know, it sounds a little brutal, I don't disagree, but I also don't love having ants crawling on me 24/7, so it's a tradeoff).\nThe way it works is, you EXPECT to see a literal sea of ants (it was TERRIFYING because I just kept thinking of that scene from Honey I Shrunk the Kids) congregating around these bait-traps like it's the last drink at the ole' saloon before Bad Bart comes to town. You can smash them if you want, but you're just working against the system at that point; recommendation to just let the weird, clear liquid do its job. After a day or two, when you no longer see the sea of ants, you can remove the used traps (there will be A LOT of ants in there) and set down a few fresh ones to temper any future interlopers.\nHere's a helpful anecdotal tip that literally everyone gave me: if you have ants, you will ALWAYS have ants. I don't know if this is true yet, but I feel like I have killed about 10 million of them so far using the above described methodology (they do come back, not sure that there's anything that can avoid that), but we'll see if in 20 years I'm still laying waste to the local ant population through my pools of murder liquid (handily stored in little plastic containers).\nOne detraction: it hurts like the dickens to tear these stupid little things open. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but twisting the tops off always hurts my fingers a little. But the effectiveness of it makes the struggle worth it.",

It may freak you out at first because it seems like you are getting more ants. It's only because once one ant finds the trap they spread the word to all their ant friends and they all come to eat. That's a good thing. The product is designed to kill them slowly. They have enough time to tell there friends about the food and bring some back to the queen. My ants are usually dead within 48 hours. It could be 4-5 days. Some will die in the liquid. Most back in there underground home. I learned not to waste these. One per room or rooms they are in. Anymore then that and mine ignore the extras lol\n\nLike the box says they last about 90 days. Now I set them out around the end Feb before it gets warm.

Scissors takes care of opening it, no problem. Be careful when you go to throw it away, you do NOT want this stuff spilling. It is not fun trying to scrub sticky dead ants and liquid ant poison off of a living room floor, let me tell you. As many times I have knocked these over, you'd think I'd learn to be more careful.

They brought the poison back to the colony and it killed them all. This stuff is amazing. Just be sure to let them do their thing over night and do not correct your enemy in the middle of a mistake.

Following the directions is critical. You need to place them near an area the ants commonly walk to have to most effect. I placed one on my windowsill by the nightstand, and two nights later there was a huge pile of dead ants all around the trap.\n\nIt seems that some species of ants don't care for this stuff, as I had some red ants in my home that never touched the bait, so I had to use some barrier spray to solve that issue, but for common house ants, it wipes out the whole colony within a week.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't a fan of is the form factor, it's fairly easy to accidentally cut too much off of the packaging, and end up with a giant, sticky mess all over your surfaces. I had to take extra care to place the traps in an area where I wasn't worried about knocking it over, or where it was at an angle for the liquid to seep out.\n\nAll in all, I will continue to buy these as long as I have ant issues in my home.",

        "content": "We had an unusually bad ant problem this summer. Normally, they would go away after a week or so and not come back until the next summer, so killing them really was not necessary and my preferred approach. However, this year they were on a different type of mission and would not leave.\n\nWe had very small ants, but probably thousands of them walking an ant trail along a path in our kitchen. I originally wanted to buy these baits because of the reviews and the idea of the sugary liquid bait made sense to me (put a couple drops of a sugary pop drink on the floor and the ants would likely swarm it). However, we have a cat and I was concerned for her safety.\n\nUltimately, we bought a different brand that did absolutely nothing. Along the ant trails, the ants would go through these baits giving a little hope at first, but the numbers did not decrease. After a week and a half of no results, I bought these baits and put a few where we can see them come into the kitchen. I covered the baits with a box and put almost 60 pounds of weights on the flaps to prevent our little one from getting to them. Fortunately, she was interested for a minute in the box on the floor (typical cat :-) ), but otherwise left it alone.\n\nFirst, the results were quick in one way. The baits immediately attracted the ants and there was a massive decrease in the ants along the previous ant trail. After an hour, I actually took the weights off and looked and they were absolutely going nuts over them. I replaced the box and left the baits alone for about 4 more days.\n\nNow, the ant problem seems to be finished. I have subsequently checked the baits and I have seen only a few still walking around them. I am leaving them for a little longer to hopefully complete the job.\n\nTwo notable observations. First, opening the baits is tricky. The instructions make it look like they tear right open, but that really was not the case. I had to work pretty hard to open them and then the entrance was all jagged etc. Next time, I will see how they open with scissors. Second, from my previous inspection, the ants have tracked a lot of the liquid solution out of the trap. Nothing can really be done about this from the manufacturer, but just a warning to those who use these. Maybe consider putting the traps on something if you are worried about your floors or other surfaces these might go one.\n\nAll in all, I think they give you a decent number of traps for the money. We have leftovers for possibly another 'invasion'. I also am very pleased on how fast the results were. Almost immediate change in the numbers due to the attraction of them to the bait and abandoning the ant trail (minus a few headstrong soldiers) and pretty much clearing up the issue in about 4 days. In my opinion, the manufacturer claims are legit.",

It has a handle, leak proof if you make sure the straw is pulled all the way, great designs, straw is covered so not always exposed when it gets thrown on the floor, even the one year old can open it. The only con I would say is it’s difficult to fully clean the straw but it’s great that you can replace it. Also, my kids have chewed through a lot of straw bottles, but these have held up quite well. Would like it in a larger size with a straw like this (I think the larger size is only a spout). My kids inhale water so I often have to fill it up. Keeps the cold with ice in it. The value is the best. I would even prefer this over more expensive brands.",

        "content": "My kids have used these cups for many years. My daughter who started middle school finally decided she couldn’t be seen with Barbie or My little pony anymore so I had to replace it with a plain one. They’ve made some improvements including ribs on the bottom of the mouth spout so you can actually grip it and pull it out to clean it. It used to be smooth and with soapy fingers that was literally impossible. They’ve changed the handle a little so it doesn’t lay flat. I’m not sure how I feel about that yet because I feel like it has more potential to be broken off because it doesn’t nestle properly but so far we haven’t had that issue. We’ve been using these in bags and the car for as long as I can remember and we have never had a leak. The only issue is - if you have something in there that gets warm it will sometimes explode out when you pop it open. We’ve only ever used it for water so that’s not a big deal but something to keep in mind if you were doing sticky beverages. One last thought is they do get holes in the mouth pieces easily if your kids are prone to chewing on the straws. I still have trouble with my son doing that however there are replacement straws on Amazon which are much cheaper than the ones that come with it. They will fit this version but they are not as easy to get out as the one that comes with it. Also, they do keep beverages cold a very long time especially if it starts out with ice. My daughter reported that she still has cold water even in the last period of her school day. On a negative note, they are not dishwasher safe. We have always hand washed ours. So if you’re somebody that doesn’t want to do that, I would not recommend these.",

        "content": "Somehow it has become my personal mission to find a truly leak proof water bottle for my children. And, while I do like this water bottle for several reasons, this one is not *exactly* leak proof.\nFirst, the pros: stainless steel insulation helps keep water cold (which would be nice if we had an ice machine..), easy to remove/clean/replace straw, the fact that the straw is protected by a lid, the handle on the lid, fun/colorful/neutral option designs, it is easy to drink water from (ie you don't have to suck hard to drink).\nCons: THIS CUP IS ONLY LEAK PROOF IF THE LID IS CLOSED. For my 3 year old, this is no problem - she is capable of opening and closing the lid unassisted. However, my 1 year old is not physically able to open/close nor intellectually capable of understanding the importance of closing the lid to prevent leakage. I will add too -- while I do like the handle, it is a bit cumbersome/my fingers get stuck when I grab the handle when the lid is open. Not a deal breaker at all, just a feature to consider.\nOverall, I do like this water bottle and will likely buy more, especially when my 1 year old is older.\nRecommend for 3+",

        "content": "I have the larger food vacuum machine I had for years. We all know the brand. The bags are really expensive and I needed more so decided to give these a try. First I will say you get a lot for the money. I do have two \"Cons\" about the item. My machine will allow you to store the roll inside. I like that feature as it also has a built-in cutter. The rolls I just bought are so big there is no way to fit them inside the machine.\n\nSo I decided instead of struggling to cut each bag I needed, I would just roll up from the other end till it was large enough but not too large to fit inside my machine. Now for the other \"Con\" of the product. I needed to seal up a few pounds of fish. The bag did not suck out all the air as my original bags. it was not a very tight seal around the food. When it starts to seal, you can see some air enter the bag and the suction around the food gives a bit.\n\nI think for the money it's a great value, maybe to seal cheese and other items you will be eating sooner. As for placing it in a freezer, I think the food will still get freezer burn. I would not trust it to freeze steaks or seafood or other meats long term. If you only need this short term it's a good choice over the more expensive. I tend to get meats and seafood on sale and sometimes it's in the freezer for 6 months. I also had corn on the cob a year later from the freezer. If sealed and vacuumed well it can last up to a year. Although better than a zip lock bag, I would not freeze items longer than a month.",

When he gave it to us, we thought \"cool...quite a little novelty item that we probably won't use.\" HE went through the included bags pretty quickly with his fish filets and deer sausage at which point we knew to whom the gift was REALLY intended. But, with the recent ridiculous rise in meat costs, we've decided to resurrect it and start buying meat in bulk from the various grocery stores \"loss leader\" ads and socking it away in our 'extra' freezer.\n\nThese bags worked perfectly in our Freska sealer, and when purchasing them in rolls like this, they are actually cheaper than ziplock freezer bags and of course there is the added benefit of sucking out all of the air that might otherwise freezer burn meat stored for long periods of time. While I can't compare to other brands, these seem plenty thick and I have had no problems with them tearing while sealing. Plus, if you have sharp edges (as another review mentioned as a potential negative, noting they were thinner than some other brands), this package came with half a dozen \"bone guards\" that could be placed inside over any rough edges to prevent this problem.\n\nI will likely run out of freezer space before using both of these rolls, but when the time comes I will order these again. Great value, and our newfound hobby will save us hundreds on various meats over the course of the coming years.",

        "content": "To start I would like to say that I have paid full price for every piece of digital hearing protection that I possess, and am not receiving anything for this/any review! I have been rather obsessed with finding the best protection over the years because I care about my hearing, will never stop shooting guns, and want to be comfortable while enjoying guns :) . I own every single one of the hearing pro sets that I discuss. If you don't want to/have time to read the whole review, I'm putting my conclusion at the top. Feel free to read the rest to figure out why I answered this way.\n\nBut here is the quick bottom line:\n\nDo not buy a knock off brand. I do not own any of them, but have tried them. Not worth saving a few dollars. Of the more affordable name brands: Walker, 3M, or Howard Leight... The Walkers are by far the best and most comfortable. But if you have a tiny bit more $ to spend, search for the \"AKT1 Sport\". Are they worth the extra money? Yes, absolutely - buy the AKT1's if you can afford them. If you already own some 3M's, Howard Leight's or Walker's and are looking for a major upgrade without breaking the bank, go for the AKT1's. I have not noticed a difference in sound or comfort (just design) between different Walker models, but I did notice the difference in sound and comfort when I got the AKT1's! Should you just save your money and buy the \"Gucci\" of ear pro, ComTacs or MSA Sordins? Probably not, but maybe depending on need.\n\nThe details:\n\nIn the $50 - $100ish range I own 5 models: Walker's Razor Slim & XCell, Howard Leight's Impact Sport, 3M's Peltor Sport Tacs, and the AKT1 Sport's.\n\nThe best hearing protection does two things. 1 - it protects your hearing, 2 - it should not be a burden or painful to wear. Walker's, Howard Leight's, and 3M's are not very comfortable for shooting after about an hour, and on my wife (smaller head) they are actually painful to wear for more than about 10 minutes. Each of them also make you sweat because of the material of the cup pads.\n\nHoward Leight - I put HL in 5th place because the sound quality is quite \"electronic-y\", and they are just downright uncomfortable for any period of time. The sound amplification of quiet sounds is quite substantial and impressive at times, however the quality of the sound itself is lacking. I don't need to hear a whisper from across the room if I can't determine whether the whisper came from a robot or a human. (Robots, although friendly looking, are usually evil, so it's important to know the difference)\n\n3M's Peltor Sport Tacs - are in 4th place because their price point was a little higher, they are still uncomfortable for long periods of time, and they are also a bit bulky for shooting rifles. The cheek plate on a rifle is almost guaranteed to nudge these muffs and cause your shooting ear to have decreased protection. They still have a bit of an artificial electronic sound, but seem to have the best overall hearing protection in this price range when shooting larger calibers or indoors (as long as you can avoid the cheek plate nudge).\n\nWalker's - The XCEL and Razor models are tied with each-other for 3rd and 2nd place. They beat out HL's & 3M's just because they are a bit more comfortable. But they are tied with each-other because they don't really have a noticeable difference in sound quality or protection. I think they are both the same Walker tech, just different designs and price points. They are both a little more comfortable, and noticeably less \"electronic-y\" sounding than the Howard's or 3M's. The sound amplification of quiet sounds is pretty impressive. But in order to make them comfortable for extended shooting times you'll have to spend $ on upgraded gel pads.\n\nThe AKT1's - take first place. I found these on Amazon and never heard of them prior to that. But I am very happy to have found them! There are only 2 little negatives: 1- they are still a bit bulky (although light weight) so the cheek plate of a rifle does nudge them, and 2 - the amplification of quiet sounds is not quite as dramatic as the other brands. However they take first place because the fit is incredibly better on the AKT1 than any of the models mentioned previously. This is true for both large and small heads actually. I think this simply because the band seems to have had a lot of thought/development put into it, and the pads on the ear cups are either real leather or really nice fake leather. Unlike the other models listed above, these are comfortable out of the box. You don't have to upgrade the pads because they are super soft and that alone is quite impressive. The sound quality is also remarkable. They may lack in magnitude of amplification, but the microphone & speakers work together to provide the least artificial sounds of any other headset I have worn (including ComTacs and Sordins). It is sometimes hard to tell if they are even turned on when someone is talking to you, because the sound quality is so good it sounds like their real life voice.\n\nLastly the $200-$400 range:\n\nPeltor ComTac's and MSA Sordin Supreme Pro-X's are pretty equivalent to eachother - I cannot decide which of these are actually better. I can say that I like the sound quality of the the speakers in the AKT1's better than both of these high dollar headsets. However they both feel more durable than the AKT1's, and the sound dampening tech in the ComTacs and Sordins are noticeably more advanced than any of the lower priced sets. If you can afford the $200-400 price, then go for them. If you need to use coms while wearing ear protection, buy them. They are the only brands that have a substantial amount of radio/mic/helmet mounting accessories readily available - and the only two that I would trust for coms reliability. The major benefit is the platform they provide. Most (if not all) come with the gel padded cups and I would buy a set with the genuine leather band cover if you use the top headband style. I prefer the Sordins, as they just seem to fit my head better than any other brand, and I am a fan of the brand name. I have not tried the newest Sordin model yet though... so I may have to update this. Are they that much better than the cheaper models? For very specific reasons yes... but if you are not actually needing the coms platform, then buy the AKT1's. Yeah, I think the AKT1's are that good!",

Could have a normal conversation while the equipment was not running and didn't have to take the protections off to hear anyone. Then as soon as the equipment turned back on, went into noise-canceling mode. Can't wait to see how these do at the range. Have not tested the headphone jack yet. Also these are really low profile compared to other noise canceling protection I have used in the past. As well as being really comfortable to wear. Work them for quite a few hours at a time and did not feel uncomfortable once. Definitely recommend, or even finding some that have Bluetooth capabilities as well.",

        "content": "So I wear a size 7 1/2 fitted cap so I have a pretty large noggin. My other shooting earmuffs were okay but didn't quite get a good seal since the earpads got stretched out whenever I put them on. I decided to upgrade and seeing that this set was pretty popular, I went for these.\nFitment wise, much better than my other ones. Took a little bit to get the earpads softened up so they could expand a bit but, well worth the effort. With a my cap and glasses, these fit my head perfectly. I did find these are a bit difficult to put your eye protection on after you put the earmuffs on so just a heads up.\nThis is my first electronic hearing protection so I wasn't really sure what to expect here. I was assuming you'd be able to pick up conversations but may get the occasional blast whenever a gun is fired. This was almost completely true. Even without the power on, you still get decent noise reduction so you can use them as-is. There is no worry about what happens with the batteries die so that's a nice relief. I shoot primarily at an indoor range and I've seen numerous complaints about these types of hearing protection working great at outdoor ranges but not so good at indoor ranges. I didn't find this to be an issue at all.\nShooting my 9mm/45 ACP indoors, these earmuffs worked well at blocking out the noise to a comfortable level. When I turned the volume on the headsets, I could hear the people in the booth next to me really clearly. The gunshots had sort of a booming/echo sound to them but it wasn't loud at all. I felt it to be really comfortable shooting my handguns. One thing I did notice is that the sound seemed to be a bit stronger in one ear than the other. My left ear sounded pretty clear while the right ear was kind of, meh. Not sure if this is expected or not but we'll see.",

        "content": "Specifically for males with large heads. To start I am 6ft 3 inches tall about 280lbs and wear a size 7 7/8 (one size below an 8). So I can say I have a pretty large head and proportionately large ears. As far as which I recommend over the other my answer is get both and see which fits you best.\n\nFitment on head I’d say they’re about the same, the Howard Leight (HL) has slightly more head space if you’re wearing a hat, which can be due to it have less padding on the band compared to the Walker Razor (WR). The HL does not squeeze my head as much so it can be more comfortable over longer periods of time. But the HL ear pads are smaller than the WR the hole size is not substantially different but it’s enough to notice. I measured the HL and it was only about 1 cm smaller across each way than the WR BUT the depth of it was 1/2 inch deep while the WR was 3/4 inch so the HL is about 1/4 not as deep which for me made the difference. The HL although comfortable, due to the depth being smaller it did not completely seal around my ears I noticed on my left ear there was some space between my neck and ear wear it was not sealing, and without a proper seal I would not feel comfortable using it. Again this is why I say try both if you have a large head, because I feel depending on head shape, ear size and where your ears sit on your head the HL may fit and since it doesn’t squeeze your head as much it would be the better option.\n\nThe WR are better looking in my opinion, the band has more padding and the ear muffs are deeper and bigger, but the band does feel tighter on your head and will not be able to be used as long as the HL.\n\nAs far as the sound goes the HL has better sound I believe, it is slightly better and since they have a fabric like cover and not a metal cover like the WR they do not pick up much wind noise.\n\nI personally stuck with the WR but I do not consider the HL to be lesser than the WR. Each has its pros and cons and I’d have to say ultimately try both. HL may fit better for wider heads. But for my WR I added gel ear pads and it has greatly improved the wearability. If you get either of these I really recommend getting the gel ear pads for added comfort.",

Ironically right after saw the instructor at the facility also using the exact same ear protection.\n\nAfter using them for a little i can say they provide just as good noise isolation as your regular low tech bubble shaped large ear protection head gear but with a fraction of the side making it easy to move around and much more comfortable to wear.\nThey also fold down to a very small footprint in size when not used and pack away with very little space needed.\n\nThe added benefit of the dual side microphones to digitally include outside noise when needed is a huge game changer allowing you to hear what people are saying easily and also comfortably talk without yelling since you can hear yourself much better as well to gauge your own volume of speech in loud environments.\n\n10/10 would recommend.",

When sharpening knives and straight razors I use this microscope to view the condition of the edge and observe the scratch pattern and I’ve never had an issue getting it to work. It is a common suggestion in the knife sharpening / razor honing world because it works well. The description says it works better when viewing an object that’s laying flat but you can definitely still make it work just fine holding it in the air, that’s the only way I use it. The magnification is great and the light helps a ton. Maybe some people got a defective product but I’m willing to bet a good portion of those reviews are user error which seems to be fairly common when it comes to negative reviews on this website.

        "content": "I originally ordered the almond birch color w/ the 3 lids. The color of the lids weren’t exactly the same as the bottle and appeared to have a slight slight greenish tint to it compared to the almond base. Wasn’t too crazy about that so I exchanged it for the lavender color. The lids are slightly off color as well, but I like the lavender more. The lavender lid will look more like a true lavender and and the bottle color pulls more pink. Overall I’m happier with this over the almond color but both are pretty!\n\nTo solve this, I wish you wish you had the option to pick black lids or same color lids — just as you have the option to select size & lid amount.\n\nSo far the bottle doesn’t leak and keeps my water nice and cold! :)",

The only note is if you plan to fly with this bottle the air valve is one-way, in. So after takeoff if you flip the straw up it will shoot water out because of the pressure change. I bought a pack of straw lids that has a 2-way air valve and don’t have that issue anymore. Definitely recommend this bottle. Ice lasts in my bottle over 24 hours.",

Kept my ice water cold for 2 days when I forgot my water in the car! I have the 64 oz so I only have to refill once to get my full gallon in! The only thing that I hate it how heavy it can get when it’s filled but I’m also carrying half a gallon so can’t complain there. I’ve had mine for about a year now and the color has not chipped or scratched! It does come with 3 lids I prefer to use the straw option but it’s nice to have the option of switching it up.

Pros: it’s easy to clean, it comes with two styles to drink from (a cap to open or the lid itself), & two straws. Cons: for me, it can leak a little sometimes. And the ice does not last 24 hours but I think it’s because I keep my house on 75 (I get cold easily) even though it’s insulated. Another con is it does not fit in my cup holders so it can be a hassle when finding a place for it in my car. But other than that, I love it. I use it every day and it works.\nI do recommend it though! And it’s at a great price point. You can order it for different sizes too (look at photos in the description!)\n\nTip: if you have a cup that you like, you’ll be more encouraged to drink out of it and that’s how I am getting enough water. Hope that helps!",

I got it because I always end up being the only one to bring their bottle with them when we go anywhere and everyone drinks mine dry. (I’ve got 3 kids). I thought this would be perfect to hold more water and it wouldn’t disappear has quick and leave some for me 😉. Well it ended up being very very heavy since it’s metal and full of water. A lot heavier than I imagined. That’s my only bad thing to say about it. Otherwise it’s durable, easy to wash, love that they come with an extra straw and pretty colors. Easy to open and close the spout for the kids. Paint stays on through many many many dish washing cycles.",

I love the quality and the lid loop design. Some companies make them really big or flimsy or sharp and awk but this is just perfect. I love the ease of cleaning and also, the fact that you get three different kids so you can pick whichever fits you best. I'm not a paid reviewer and I'm not joking when I say Simple Modern is a good quality and economical brand. The bottle (and the tumbler) keep ice cold enough that it doesn't melt quickly--which is super important where I live because it gets VERY hot in Arizona. In the summer, I have left the bottle empty with just ice cubes in my car and can come out the next morning to cool/room temp water without it being warm or hot. I hope that you can see how much I love this brand by the fact that I have bought both the tumbler and bottle.",

Few issues are that the air pressure to high, so I doubt if smaller kids might be able to operate. Also, it heats up pretty quickly. We did about 50 balloons in about 30-40 min or so. Except for the air pressure and heating issue, this is a decent product. Buy based on whether adults plan to use or kids, if adults, its a good products, but for kids I do not recommend this.",

As someone who has no experience with balloon decor whatsoever, I was a bit apprehensive about using it. However, I found the process to be incredibly easy and straightforward.\n\nThe dual nozzle design was particularly useful for me as it allowed me to inflate multiple balloons at once, saving me a lot of time. The color of the blower, rose red, is also very attractive and adds a touch of elegance to the decor.\n\nThe 600W electric motor is powerful enough to inflate even the largest of balloons with ease. I was also pleased to find that the noise level was minimal, which made the process even more pleasant.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add some balloon decor to their next event. The ID IDAODAN Portable Dual Nozzle Rose Red 110V 600W Electric Balloon Blower Pump/Electric Balloon Inflator for Decorations is a great investment for anyone looking to add some fun and color to their party.

We have several mice in our house (there’s a lot of new houses being built nearby, so they are just getting pushed out of their environment). I paid an exterminator $800 to seal any openings and set traps. He used a few snap traps and those things didn’t catch Jack squat. I heard two of the snap traps go off but they didn’t catch anything. We caught 3 mice with these glue traps! It’s embarrassing to admit having vermin in our home, but these will definitely help catch them! I have a dog and a baby so I didn’t want to use poison- plus the exterminator said if the vermin eats poison they just go and die inside your walls and then you have the dead smell to deal with. Just put these to block the paths where you think the mice are using.\n\nThese traps are STICKY so if you have a pet that gets stuck to it- my dog made the mistake of picking up the trap once a mouse was caught and it ended up getting stuck to my dog’s paw. I put (a lot of) olive oil on a folded paper towel and really had to wipe to get all the residue off his foot (then I washed his paw with soapy Dawn water cuz gross!)\n\nBut great product- super effective",

I wish these were slightly larger, because both mice got stuck on the edge and worried me about whether they'd be ever to pull themselves free since it was only 1 or 2 of their feet stuck. The second mouse dragged itself and the trap toward the hole they're coming out of, and I think it might have soon been able to free itself since it chewed at the trap itself and was barely still stuck. I placed a dab of peanut butter on the center. Stickiness does the trick, though, and it's simple to set up, which is what I'm looking for since I'm afraid to set other traps. Just make sure you keep checking these since they do not kill the mouse.",

        "content": "This review is for Amazon Basics Microfiber Cleaning Cloths, Non-Abrasive, Reusable and Washable - Pack of 24, 12 x16\nColor-fast and with a nice edging that does not ravel. I have not tried using these for \"deep cleaning.\"\n\nHaving read some comments that machine laundering may gradually reduce their effectiveness, I wash them by hand and hang to dry, unless they are unusually dirty. No fabric softeners, of course, as they reduce absorption. I keep clean cloths handy for wiping down the chrome fixtures in the kitchen, bathroom sinks, and shower--expecting by these means to prevent spots of corrosion from developing because the water in So. Cal. being very \"hard.\"\nI have also found them very good for cleaning our brushed stainless steel refrigerator and Magic Chef microwave oven. We wanted a white fridge, but constraints of sizing and supply forced us to buy stainless, and I was worried because many people write about how it shows fingerprints. The company selling it also sells a special compound to remove them, but I found a DIY online that calls only for white vinegar and a cloth that leaves no fuzz--i.e., microfiber. Keeping a spray bottle of vinegar and one of these cloths handy, I have found that \"fingerprinting\" is no problem whatsoever.\nIf anyone here is considering getting microfiber cloths for cleaning stainless steel appliances, be aware that brushed stainless steel has a sort of \"grain\" to it. You can see very tiny lines all going in one direction; that is the \"brushing.\" Spray a bit of the vinegar on a microfiber cloth and wipe in the direction of the grain to remove dirt and fingerprints. Wipe again with a dry section of the cloth to remove any residue of vinegar, which seems to remove the necessity of rinsing, and if any fingerprints persist, re-wiping with a tiny bit of olive oil on the cloth somehow miraculously takes care of them. Polish again with a clean part of the cloth, and done. Most of the time I find I am \"one and done” with just the vinegar, and I love these cloths.\nI like that they came in white, blue, and yellow, so I can assign different colors to different jobs. If there is anything particularly dirty, or a potential for staining, I plan to use the white ones for that, so I can give them whatever laundry treatment seems necessary. By the way, neither the blue nor the yellow has bled into the laundry water and caused trouble with white garments being washed together with these cloths. I recall reading a comment about such bleeding, and can only assume that it refers to a different product, as Amazon sometimes lumps together the reviews for similar, but not identical, products.",

        "content": "These cloths are the most amazing and versatile cleaning product I've ever used! I had no idea when I bought them how many things you could clean with them and how many cleaning products they would replace. Here's a sample. They can easily replace:\n\n*Paper towels\n*Windex, Glass Plus, etc.\n*Comet, Ajax (except in the worst cases)\n*Mr. Clean Magic Sponge (they work exactly like Magic Sponge on light grease buildup)\n*All kinds of soap/cleaning products\n\nUsing just water with these cloths, you can clean so many things that used to require soap and water. Like a greasy stove, or the grease build-up in your kitchen and bathroom sinks.\n\nThe real trick to keeping your house clean is to clean often before the dirt and grease have a chance to build up. But when you have to use soap - it really discourages you from doing it too often because everything turns into such a big job. Like, would you really clean your microwave after every couple of uses? No! Because it's too much work to clean something that's not that dirty yet. You have to use some kind of soap with water, then you have to use more water and a few more minutes to rinse away all the soap. So most people just wait until it's dirty enough to make all that work worth it. But with these, you can literally clean after every use. Just wet one, and wipe the microwave down one time (10 seconds max)... and you're done! The end result: the microwave is NEVER dirty!\n\nAnd it's so easy to clean things that used to be so hard. For instance, if you want to keep your stove sparkling clean after cooking a meal that resulted in a lot of greasy splatter... just fold these twice, wet one side and after you finish cooking wipe down the stove, then turn it over and wipe again with the drier side. Then take a second one that's dry and wipe one more time. And voila, your stove will be completely clean, no grease or oil left! They're really amazing. And I LOVE not having to use soap on everything. It makes it so much simpler and quicker to clean.\n\nI actually enjoy cleaning now, because it's so quick and easy. The trick on cleaning things like your stove is to do it often. I do it every 3-4 times I cook. I should do it every 2-3 times. But the point is to do it often enough that the grease splatter doesn't have a chance to build up so much that you need something stronger to clean it with.\n\nThey are also so absorbent that they'll soak water right off anything they touch. I even find myself reaching for them when I want to dry my hands quickly - because I know they'll suck the water right off. They don't feel as good on your hands as a soft cloth or paper towel does - but they do a much better job at drying them.\n\nThey dry very fast too. If I soak one in water, and then wring it out, it will be dry within 3-4 hours.\n\nYou can clean all kinds of things with them, from the stove, to sinks to windows and mirrors. I've even used them on my eyeglasses - although I'm not sure that's a good idea as they may rub the various coatings off after a while. But I did it on an old pair so no harm done - and they clean every bit as well as my old eyeglasses spray and a paper towel did. And all you need are one of these cloths and a few drops of water!\n\nThey're also amazing at picking up dust when they're wet or dry. Just wipe the surface once and the dust is instantly gone.\n\nI've found the quickest and easiest way to clean most things from windows to stove tops is what I suggested above for the stove. I take two of them and fold them over twice. Then I wet one side and wipe it all over whatever surface I want to clean. Then wipe again with the backside which should be a little drier. This will pick up all the excess water, which will then make it easy to fully dry with the second dry cloth. Just use it to wipe one more time to fully dry the surface. Seriously, what could be simpler or quicker? I can clean my stove, microwave, dining room table, plus two glass living room tables all in less time than it used to take me to clean just the stove!\n\nI've put a couple of these in my shower. And every other morning after I shower, I take one and wipe down the glass doors, then I wring it out and wipe them again. Then I take another dry one and wipe one more time. The doors are spotlessly clean and there's never any build up from evaporating water. No water spots! In all, less than a minute every couple of days to keep the glass shower doors spotless!\n\nThese are saving me a TON of money in soaps and various other cleaning products!",

I have used the high end tech name brands and I can tell you that unless you are needing some special quality paper for something (resumes, certificates, awards,etc), this is the exact same copy paper you will get from anywhere or any brand. Paper is paper...that pretty well sums it up. It's not like this is some cheap/thin, easy to jam/tear, ruined by ink/machine use, cheaply made/low functionality paper like I suppose apparently some people may think judging by the questions I've answered about it. This printer/copy paper is solid white, blank paper, of the same size and thickness of every other regular multi-purpose printer/copier paper on the face of the planet. However, there is ONE difference and it's a HUGE one, I mean game changer difference....it's about HALF the price per case than those well known tech name brand cases, same product, only cheaper. That is why I chose to purchase THIS particular case of paper, it's a very smart business decision to save money without risking and quality reduction. Highly recommend and will NEVER pay those insane prices for PAPER again after finding and trying this. Ordering any other paper by the case is just a complete and total waste of funds that could be used in other areas.",

Great for everyday copying.

I had to trim the driver’s side mat but the passenger mat fit perfectly! I had cut the back mat into three separate pieces and trim them down to the smallest size possible, but they all fit into my floorboards nicely. They’re also very easy to cut. Just make sure you have a sharp, heavy duty pair of scissors. I used a sharpie to mark x’ son the pieces I needed to trim. The sharpie worked for me but it was sort of hard to see, so I would recommend using a paint pen if you have one. I see a lot of reviews mention a “strong, bad smell” from the rubber, but I did not have that problem. I was worried that at this price point I wouldn’t get a quality product, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you’re hesitant to order, don’t be!",

Moving out to my parents in the rural area (more dirt, mud, no highway at times) there were times it was difficult to keep the carpet clean! My car is my sole form of transport so I try and take care of it to the best of my ability. I saw these mats and what attracted me to them was the large size of the front mats - based on the photos I saw - and also the continuous rear floor mats. Here is the skinny on the fit. Front mats are perfect! The coverage is great for the Olds Alero! The rear mats will need to be cut. I cut mine down the middle. There is enough leftover to create an overlap. I used velcro on the overlap to keep the rear mats together. The top part of each rear mat will also need to be cut as well for front seat track clearance. The mats look great now and have better coverage than my old ones! My car has a gray interior but the black mats complement it. Highly recommended!",

The rubber is hard and durability should not be a problem, but be prepared to work a bit or use a very sharp blade to trim to fit to your vehicle. These have a nice raised edge that should contain water and snow / debris as well. My sole complaint is that they seem to take on a bit of a chemical like odor when heated -- in winter, they are exposed to vehicle heating and mine smelled rough after the first install. It has gone away, and I am not sure if others noticed. All that said, for $30 and some elbow grease to cut them to fit, extremely hard to beat for me.",

The driver's seat one keeps sliding around, possibly because that's the seat that is used most often, and the backseat one was very difficult to situate in my car (I drive a used 2020 Subaru Crosstrek), although I rarely have backseat passengers, so this isn't a huge issue. They work well enough, and they'll do for now, but I do kind of wish I'd just sprung for something custom-fitted to my specific car. I gave them four stars because they are waterproof, and they get the job done, but I personally found the installation process too frustrating to be worth it. I thought about returning them, but since I'd already started to cut them up to try to make them work, I obviously couldn't. But who knows, maybe you'll have better luck.",

        "content": "I ordered this stuff for my wife, as we have a new neighbor in the area we live in who is really being over friendly toward her. Unfortunately he will not approach her when I am around, so I made the investment. To help her gain some confidence in her device, I let her test it on me...\nDo not do as I did.\n\nTo give you some background, I am a career military soldier, with 4 deployments to Iraq. After my last tour I took a job as a bodyguard. I am also a patron of concerts and clubs. Suffice it to say I've been exposed to some of the best crowd control in the business.\nYou have about 5 to 10 seconds of coherance (barely) after contact, and after that, your only concern is pain. Even with my prior experiance, I was completely incapacitated. If I were an earnest attacker, this would deter my attack immediately. My wife is not a trained combatant, and she hit me with a glancing spray across my cheek and that was enough to stop me. (Ideally one would draw a line from ear to ear for max. effect)\nThere is no quick cure for the pain, as is the case with most OC sprays. Even with the coolit spray which is intended to reduce the effects, you are still out of action for at least 30 minutes.\n\nSome tips when using this product.\n-TEST YOUR PRODUCT WHEN YOU OPEN IT!!! There is a 1 in 5000 chance that your device may be defective. Go outside and spray a few lines downwind just to be sure it will not fail you in that critical moment.\n-AFTER YOU SPRAY someone, LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY. If you stay, your assailant may go into a rage which not even OC spray can stop. If you decide to take the fight to the attacker, then you risk losing your right to self defense and crossing over to getting an assault charge. Just go. When you are safely gone, call the police and inform them of the situation. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT\n-AFTERCARE IS CRITICAL. After you spray someone, you must call an ambulance. If your attacker or anyone who may have been caught up in the spray as well is asthmatic or has allergies you could wind up killing them. That is grounds for a manslaughter charge at least.\n-IF YOU SPRAY YOURSELF, that really sucks. There is no quick fix. Find a safe location and wait it out. Use soap and water to rinse yourself repeatedly and allow air to get to the affected area. Expect to be out of action for an hour. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ALLOW THIS STUFF TO COME IN CONTACT WITH YOUR HANDS. Your hands are the primary means for spreading contamination, and if you spray your pocket, and then scratch your head, you will know. Also, go ahead and trash those clothes you were wearing, this stuff can contaminate an entire load of laundry.\n\nHopefully you will never have to use this stuff on anybody. It is truely hell. The best defense is paying attention to what you are doing, the way you are presenting yourself, and avoiding uneasy situations.\nThis review is in no way intended to be subsituted for legal advice.",

I was feeling very threatened and so kept my hand on the trigger as he threatened and shouted, and when he attacked me all it took was two quick sprays and he was completely incapacitated. He couldn't inflict any damage on me even though he is a bodybuilder and MUCH bigger than me. The only problem is that when I sprayed it he was tackling me and so some of the spray hit me. I was probably hit with only 10% of the spray but I can tell you it was TERRIBLE. It was so powerful that the cops couldn't stay in the house for long because of the residual in the air. So maybe next time I'll practice shooting it more. In sum, the Sabre spray saved me from definite injury and I cannot be more satisfied with this product. I will feel much safer now holding it.",

I bought this pepper spray but was always scared about what if I was attacked and it didn’t work when I needed it to.\n\nThe other night I sprayed it while out walking my pups just to see the range. Somehow a tiny drop got in my eye — holy crap! I was immediately blinded and choking like crazy. It spread to my other eye when I was trying to get it out of my one eye. So basically I’m stumbling around in my neighborhood looking crazy unable to see anything. For the half a second I could open one eye, all I saw were my two dogs looking at me with a judgey look like “mom, you dumb.” So yes, this stuff works.",

Although I have not had to use them thankfully and hopefully never do, I can point out some things to keep in mind. The lock feature is good and easy to unlock, revealing or hiding the nozzle. The only reason I give it four stars for the lock feature itself is because if a child has this in their hand, they can also easily unlock it and spray it accidentally on their eyes. I know obviously we know when we buy it to keep it away from kids but, it's something to keep in mind. It's light weight, easy to conceal it. I have it in my pocket where I can quickly take it out. Has a quick release keychain clip. I prefer no clip and hav it seperate from my keys. Wether your a man or woman, this is far better/safer than a knife for protection. A firearm is best but only if you have practice but also, if you know you will not be afraid to use it in that dangerous situation when your adrenaline is very high. overall I recommend it.",

Put the hooks up and waited twenty four hours before hanging anything on them. They have been in place for two months with kids school back packs and jackets hanging from them everyday with no issues. They do look a little bulky compared to the usual small command hooks, but for me it was a much better option than finding a stud and screwing a hook into the wall permanently.",

Santa puts a LOT of HEAVY stuff in our stockings and the heavy duty hooks with these refill strips keep our stockings attached to the fireplace throughout the holiday season. Even when we have a fire burning every night, these little babies hang on tight. When the season is over, and it’s time for the stockings to come down, we simply pull on that magic little tab at the bottom, and they come right off the wall without leaving a mark. Can’t say enough good things about Command hooks and refill strips! Don’t be fooled by the imitations. We were out of refill strips this year and Amazon couldn’t get us these strips right away, so I ordered some of the imitation ones to use temporarily until the real thing came in. What a mistake. Hooks and stockings were flying off the wall from the heat left and right. But then we couldn’t get the super sticky oversized strips off the wall. That off-brand SUCKED! There is no substitute for the real thing! Insist on Command BRAND refills every time!",

Take aim and unleash 1 dart at a time in indoor and outdoor games, or blast into slam fire action to send all 6 darts flying through the air in rapid succession. This Nerf kids blaster includes 12 Nerf Elite foam darts, so you can fill the drum and keep additional darts in reach for reloads. Take on the competition with pump action blasting. Load the drum, pump the priming slide backward and forward, and pull the trigger to launch a dart. To slam fire, hold down the trigger and keep pumping the slide back and forth. The foam dart blaster has 2 tactical rails and attachments points for a stock and a barrel to customize with Nerf accessories (each sold separately, subject to availability). Designed for distance, the blaster fires darts up to 90 feet (27 meters). Kids toys like Nerf Elite 2.0 toy foam blasters are great gifts for 8 year old boys and girls who enjoy active indoor and outdoor play. Eyewear recommended (not included).

        "content": "My ProChrono Digital chronograph measured the speed of the darts fired by this stock Nerf Commander blaster at an average of 73 feet per second (FPS) using Nerf Elite 2.0 darts (it is capable of shooting any blue, green, white, orange, yellow, Accustrike, or any decorated darts). The typical average velocity of a Nerf Elite blaster is 65-70 FPS, so this blaster is an overachiever in this regard.\n\nThe Commander has Slam-fire. For those who don’t know what that is, it is the ability to fire off darts in rapid succession by holding down the firing trigger and repeatedly priming the blaster to fire a dart off every time it is primed, resulting in some semblance of rapid fire. The tradeoff of using this function is often the reduced accuracy due to the shaking of the blaster while it is being furiously primed. Being a top-priming slide blaster does not help this pistol’s aim either, but at least it has a rear shoulder stock attachment point. I have found that the Nerf Elite Stockade’s shoulder stock is ideal in fit and function since it holds spare darts that you will need to reload the Commander’s meager 6-dart capacity. This is one dart more than the Nerf Elite Spectre, the original Spec-Ops rear-stock and front-barrel attachment springer blaster; I see the Commander as a reiteration of that ghost. The Commander has Slam-fire where the Spectre didn’t. The reloading on the Commander is much easier than what was once a button-push-and-pop-out-cylinder on the Spectre. You simply reload a few darts, rotate the cylinder, then reload the rest. But that is easier said than done if you are in a Nerf War (competitive “Nerfers” would never be caught armed with this as their primary blaster in such a useless situation). Another improvement is the 3 tactical rails located: 1 above the front barrel, 1 under the cylinder, and 1 oddly placed under the pistol grip as a part of the hand guard. The hand guard makes the grip a bit cramped for people with larger hands. Ergonomics are slightly affected by that fact, but for most I believe it will suffice. I do not like the micro faux-sling-mount aesthetic at the bottom- rear portion of the pistol grip because it serves no purpose but to be annoying to your hand. Perhaps even worse than the “tooth” aesthetic just below it (which also serves no functional purpose, by the way. I know, I have tried to use it to prime other top-priming blasters; It slips). The shell plastic parts are somewhat appealing. The large orange “ELITE 2.0” label shows well. The painted name and NERF logo on one side and not the other is consistent with the cost-cutting habits that Hasbro has implemented on most Nerf products. As far as cheapness goes, I am hearing a lot of rattling and squeaking of the plastic going on during operation of the Commander. In conclusion, it is a wonder if this product will last the test of time. The Spectre that the Commander embodies did not last very long before breaking, but perhaps this blaster will take after the Elite Strongarm (and last through the ages). I can see this being something to use to casually play around with in a close quarters (CQB) indoor or in-office use. In that light, perhaps there are smaller options that offer the same performance. This blaster is rather on the large side for what it is: The multiple Nerf Accessory attachment points contribute to the blaster’s problem with being over-sized and difficult to holster. And a primary blaster typically has an onboard dart capacity that exceeds a mere handful of darts. The creakiness of the plastic shell and internal parts do not give one the sense of confidence in the dependability and longevity of this blaster. At face value, the Commander is definitely a winner compared to just about all the other blasters in the failed Elite 2.0 family line, touting a decent FPS performance and not failing at everything else it was set out to do unlike almost all of it’s brethren. We will just have to see if that fact matters any in due time.",

        "content": "Been having this fryer for 2 weeks now and it has NOT rested yet. I LOVE IT & wonder how I've gone this long w/out one. Before I start bragging on this thing, I am by no way endorsed by Ninja or getting paid by them. I've owned a few Ninja products blenders and still have one that's over 10 years old. They make quality machines. This fryer is a life & time saver...especially if you're a lazy cook. I have been researching air fryers for the past few months and nothing comes close to the Ninja. The basket size isn't the large 5+ quart capacity like the bigger fryers, (Ninja is only 4qt), but this thing cooks so fast you won't miss the extra 1 qt. It comes w/ a crisper that works perfectly, a recipe book and a multi-layer rack. The first night I had it I made wings and I tell you that I will NEVER buy fried chicken again!!! Yes, they were that crispy and tasted much better. I bought the Louisiana fried chicken flour from Walmart, battered the wings, spritzed w/ a little olive oil and had fried chicken in 10 minutes. No greasy mess, no 3rd degree burns from hot oil, and your house doesn't smell like a chicken joint for 4 days afterward. Because the Ninja uses a ceramic coating on their fryers the clean up is very easy. Next, I made sweet potato fries! Had a bag of frozen ones in the freezer and popped those babies in for 10 min. They were crispier than McDonald's. I tried homemade fries but the procedure takes too long. You have to peel, slice, soak potatoes, dry them...I'm just ready to pop them in the fryer and eat! It has been nonstop air fryer cooking in this house! I hit youtube to get a few recipes and it's been on ever since. What I like best about this fryer is it has a dehydrator feature and how fast it cooks. Frozen chicken wings? No problem! Throw them in the fryer for 10 minutes and they're defrosted. I've cooked pizza, fries, wings, reheated food, fried zucchini, and tonight I baked a chocolate cake. Everything came out perfect! Next up is donuts! The only thing I don't like about this fryer is 30 seconds after it finishes cooking it shuts off. I know this is a safety feature but I always have more items to cook. In 2 weeks, I have used my microwave twice, and that was to reheat coffee. Before I forget, I did cinnamon rolls too! I used the canned Pillsbury ones and it normally takes 20 min in the oven. In the Ninja? 8 minutes and that's if you like them brown. I actually could have stopped it at 5 min and they would be perfect. My house smelled like a Cinnabon factory!😛 I have used every feature on this fryer except the dehydrator but I'll be making beef jerky soon. Overall, I am VERY pleased! The best selling feature was the price & the size. The Ninja is much slimmer than some of the bulkier fryers and fits under my cabinet nicely. I'm also happy it only used 1500W unlike some of the larger fryers that burn 1800 which could kill your light bill. The outside of the fryer doesn't get hot so you won't have to worry about getting burned but do take caution when taking your food out. Is it loud? My exhaust fan on my stove is louder than the Ninja. The extension cord on it is long so you don't have to worry about being limited on where you can place it. I think I've covered everything? This thing is THE BOMB! If you're wondering what cookware you can use, just about anything you place in a microwave you can put in the Ninja. I went to the Dollar Tree and bought a few 7\" foil pans I use to reheat food & bake in. Also, grab you some silicone tongs while you're there so you don't scratch the surface of your fryer. This thing has been almost as good as a kid getting a new bike for Christmas. You will NOT be disappointed w/ this purchase. Happy & healthy cooking!",

I do use olive oil when I cook but maybe Ill use it on the food after the food is done cooking. I like the fact that it shuts off automatically. It gets taking used to for the controls but Ive only used the air fryer so far, not the other buttons.\n\nCons: It seems very loud while its working. In fact, I had my fire extinguisher in my hand, but nothing happened. I stood in from of it for the whole time-20 mins to make sure nothing was going wrong. I wish it was quieter. When it shuts off, it makes one beep, which is not loud and I am hard of hearing. I wish it had more beeps when the food was done.\n\nI would recommend this product, but may be too loud for some people. If things change, I will update the review.",

        "content": "Wow, this thing is great. So, we finally broke down and got an air fryer. I read the reviews and for the money this Ninja one looked like the best deal. Let me tell you something this thing is great. So, it cooks faster than an oven but probably slower than deep frying. It produces crisp, good tasting food that is almost as good as fried.\nAs a fatty I got to say I love my fried food. The air fryer tastes much better than baked and better for you than fried. I mean I can tell a difference now, don’t get me wrong. It is not going to taste like French fries deep fried in lard, but its close.\nI decide I am going to make hot wings. Good idea, right? Well the first batch came out great. Even better than fried because they were a bit crispier. So, I decide I want to have a glass of wine while I cooked. This was my first mistake. God, I wished I had just went with whiskey. So, I insert the corkscrew into the cork and pop, it broke. Oh well, I thought let’s see what the internet has to offer on alternative methods of wine bottle opening.\nThe first option is to screw a screw into the cork then pry it out using the screw as a lever. Well, I can’t do that because the corkscrew is broken off into the cork. The second option said to use a lighter to heat but the air in the neck of the bottle and the cork will rise out. The third option was to place the bottle in a shoe to not break the glass. Then smack the shoe against a wall. I went with option two. Note this was my second mistake.\nSo, I break out the old lighter and start heating the glass up. Mind you I am also flipping my chicken wings in the air fryer while starting to heat up some hot sauce and other ingredients on the stove for my buffalo sauce. I decided I needed help so enlisted my 18-year child to hold the lighter up to the glass while I cooked. No good, this trick isn’t working.\nI tell him he can stop we are going to go with option three, the shoe. Here comes the third mistake. I grabbed the bottle. Yep you read that right I bare handed the bottle that I had ben applying a direct flame to for over 5 minutes. To top it off I grabbed the neck. This resulted in the most pain I have ever felt in my entire life. This is the pain Atreyu felt when Artax sunk in the swamp of sadness. This was the pain worse than 10 kicks to the balls. This was real pain. Kidney stones have nothing on my hand at this moment. I was done. My hand felt like it had melted to the bottle.\nRemember my son that I had help me? Well he is still there, and I must look like a man so I can’t cry, but boy did I want to cry. I haven’t wanted to cry this bad sense I watched “Ole yeller”. Despite the pain and fighting back tears. I managed to place the bottle in my shoe and set it on the table. I am still wanted to try that trick.\nI then went into first aid mode, hand in the sink water running, ahhhh sweet relief. Unfortunately, that was not to last. The cool water only did so much. I decided burn creme would work. Nope don’t have any. Back to the water. Perhaps some ice. Ahhh flip the wings, run the water, check the sauce wait ….\nThe pot isn’t simmering. Why is the cutting board on the stove look funny? Yep mistake four here I come. I turned on the wrong burner and now my plastic cutting board has turned to liquid on my stove. Hand back in water again. I then retrieve my putty knife to scrape the stove clean. This causes wisps of plastic string to go from the stove to the sink. Hand goes back into the water.\nAt some point my son decides to wake the wife. Did I mention this was at about 1 am? She come into the kitchen and sees me. With one shoe one, a bottle of wine on the table inserted into my shoe. Note she mentions that is the shoe I walk into bathrooms in and its on her table. She then notices the burnt cutting board and an abundance of melted plastic in the sink. She then simply asks “hot wings hu?”\nShe is a god wife and wants me to go to the hospital for my possible 3rd degree burns on my hand but me, being a man, I decide I can tuff it out. She ends up getting me more ice and leaving my son in charge to go back to bed once she understands I am not budging on the whole doctor thing.\nAnyway, in conclusion the hot wings were the best I have ever made. Although eating them one handed was a bit of a chore. I stayed up all night in pain and now I am out of ice. I never did open that bottle of wine. Also, that air fryer rocks.",

I didn't at first though as it sat for some weeks as I wasn't sure what I would make in it. When Black Friday came I ordered an Instant Vortex Airfryer so that I could compare the 2 due to all the reviews I saw.\n\nThis Ninja one has a round basket. The Instant Vortex has a square one. Although the many reviews I looked at said go with the square one because it has more surface, that isn't the case with this one. They looked the same and I measured it out. What the Ninja did have was more space as far as depth.\n\nWhat sold me was the Ninja basket is dishwasher safe. It feels more sturdy than the Instant Vortex. The reviews for the Instant Vortex had many complaining of the handle breaking off when dropped. I can see that.\n\nThe one I received did have the rubber smell when it first heated up. But it dissipated after the preheat. It hasn't smelled since.\n\nI started with breaded salmon as the first item. I was pleasantly surprised how it turned out. Baked potatoes rolled in oil with salt took only 30 minutes compared to the oven. That was nice. I've tried different vegetables and they all seem to come out good.\n\nNote that this model doesn't have auto shut off when you open the basket. I don't think that is a big deal. There is a button right next to the handle to pause it.\n\nI think this one is a keeper.",

        "content": "Yeah, I bought the wrong ones because I've got bad mold sensitivities. However, I was just a little lazy about changing filters and my motor burned out. I'm one of those that take a good 20x20 Lasko fan and put one of these behind it. I filled the corners to make it a ducted fan and the sound level drops WAY down. But having the 1000 Merv 11, I've got loads of airflow, just crazy amounts. The fan itself wasn't made to be ducted so the reduction in fine filtration made the airflow difference and will actually prevent this burnout from happening again, though I've only had it once. I think that was one of the water resistant motors which are closed. The open case motor is much cooler since air flows around the rotor and now it's getting more air in general. So I'm not getting as good filtration, in mold and tiny stuff, but since these fans aren't really made for pulling hard, even with my difficult to make duct, the 1000 is probably better in the long run. It blows really well on 1, so I will save some electricity and make my fans last a lot longer. These good Lasko fans aren't cheap. I had one last 25 years but it didn't have a filter behind it. I used it for a couple years with a filter and it seized an old dried up bearing. So I should have known that pulling air through filters with these heats things up and that will shorten the life, but it all connected when I got out my new filters and \"Hey, It's sure blowing like crazy. No wonder. I got the 1000s.\" Now I remember making this decision on purpose for these very reasons, but before the motor burned out. So if there are others like me out there, I'd recommend the Merv 11, or 1000 because our fans will last longer. Maybe I just waited too long to change it. Well, that's possible. Maybe if you're better at changing filters, there's no problem with the 1550, but another plus with the 1000s is that they're cooler in the summer, blowing clean air at you from across the isle and on #1 setting. #2 is great and if I were to put the new motor into the ducted frame, the sound would pipe down. I guess it's like everything. How much time and how good is your back to make or reuse a ducted fan? I'll say this, If you want to make a ducted fan, get the pink or blue foam boards at Home depot. I found a purple piece of packaging foam and that cuts like butter. It's great to work with and sound absorbing. Don't use styrene foam, (brittle, crusty stuff). It's hard to deal with in every way. I wish there's someplace to buy these online. That makes it so much easier that it's not such a dreaded task at all. Anyway, Merv 11 will allow better air flow and that might help make up somewhat for the difference in filtration but I know the 1000s are not going to ruin a Lasko in 7 years. They'll last forever (essentially) on these Merv 11s. In this hot weather, I'm enjoying that better airflow. I also recommend the Lasko fan combo. Esp on these 1000s. They really keep the air in the house clean. I had my carpets cleaned and he said, \"you're gonna have a lot of dust here on the AC inlet louvres. Well? (he tries again.) Huh. These are completely clean. Not a speck.\" He walks off mumbling \"I don't know why it's so clean...\". It's the Lasko/3m combination. It cleans SO MUCH air. I can go 2 years on a house filter and even then I don't see dust, I just assume it's there. It has to be. My inlet grates are spotless. Anyway, it really works and for so little money. I don't even bother to tape it up. The vacuum of the fan pulls it into the fan. That's the first thing I noticed. It barely pulled. That's the difference between the Merv 13 and Merv 11. It is a matter of preference ultimately, so try one of each. Keep the one you don't like because it's a lot better than nothing. (Unless you've got loads of money, I guess. I'm more of a waste not want not. It's not exactly true, but the saying has a point.) Anyway, I almost forgot. I prefer these filtretes over Filterbuy and others. They're sturdier and I believe they filter better, the MERV ratings being equal, the 3M is better made and it filters better, though I'll use a Filterbuy on the house system, for some reason. There's a frame around the house filter. So sturdiness isn't as important. These 20x20s for the Lasko fan are moved around, bumped into. They take the punishment and never get damaged. 3M really knows how to box these up, by the way. They're glued everywhere and it's very hard to open. Be careful.",

        "content": "We have had a Honeywell F50F Electronic furnace filter with its two high voltage collection modules for over 25 years and it just does not seem to be collecting the dust like it used to. That lack of apparent dust collection, combined with a lot of sneezing in the morning when the furnace turns on, prompted us to look at replacing the Honeywell electronic filter. After some research and careful measurements we discovered we could replace the original electronic metal modules with passive media filters and determined that the Filtrete 20x25x4, AC Furnace Air Filter MPR 1000 should fit....AND IT DOES! A perfect fit in all dimensions. The only thing is one needs to remove a guide in the bottom center of the Honeywell housing which is easily done with a screw driver (see the attached picture). Once that is removed the filter slides in with enough friction that we know it provides good air seal on all edges. The length was also perfect and the housing door closes securely. See the attached picture when installed in the Honeywell housing.\nThis MERV 11 filter has only been installed for a few days but during the morning furnace house warm up, there was no sneezing so I have high hopes this filter or even the more effective MERV 13 version will be our ultimate solution to the F50F electronic modules replacement.\nThe paper pleats would not be cleanable with compresses air without destroying the small particle filtering and as its paper it cannot be washed and must be replaced.\nThe packaging for the filter states it is good for 1 year and at $60 for 2 filters, that's a very reasonable annual maintenance cost for the filter replacement and our health.\nThis filter will fit into either the F50F or the F300 Electronic Filter housing. Just be sure to turn off or remove the power to the F50F module.\nThe package comes with 2 filters so we are good for 2 years of sneezeless mornings!",

I decided to try these 3M filters because many of the reviews mentioned filter effectiveness at reducing allergies and the like. I have not had my filter installed long enough to comment on that. But the striking thing is how much less work the air handler had to do. I don't hear that big sucking noise from the air return any more. 3M seems to have really reduced the air resistance in these filters as their product description says. I went with MERV11 filters (a better filtration level than the base MERV8). But the quietness shows that even with a MERV11 filter, there seems to be minimal air resistance.",

        "content": "I originally gave these four stars because the focus has play in it. I bumped them up to 5 stars because of the low price and the fantastic astronomical views. They stay in the focus you put them in, but the play occurs only during adjustment. My 16x50 is much better for daytime sight seeing.\n\n1. The eyepiece lens is 23mm, vs 18mm for my Nikon Aculon 16x50, 16mm for my Celestron 10x50, and 13mm for my Tasco 7x35. Despite this, they have the same eye relief as the smaller binoculars, and also a moderately smaller apparent field of view.\n2. I followed the exit pupil, drew a triangle, and quickly and accurately measured the apparent field of view of the Celestron 25x70 to be only 57.5 degrees, and that is the maximum no matter where your eye is. My Nikon's are 61 degrees, my Celestron 10x50 is 60 degrees, and my Tascos are 58 degrees. Visual observation confirms these math measurements.\n3. They are noticeably heavier than my other binos, but not a lot.\n4. They are easy to hand hold very steady in the day time, without resting my elbows on anything. At night it is much better to have something to brace my elbows on.\n5. They look like they are good quality, other than the thin strap.\n6. They are 10.4 inches long, and 8 inches wide.\n7. There depth of focus is less than that of lower powered binoculars, so I really have to adjust them as I aim around at stuff terrestrially at different distances. These are better for astronomy than for birding. My 10x and lower did not need to be adjusted much unless I looked at something really close. My 16x is in between, but still pretty forgiving.\n8. The focus is smooth but has a short lag, and requires diopter adjustment of the right eye to compensate for the lag. In cold weather, the focus wheel is tighter than any of my other binos, but still reasonable enough to turn.\n9. I am a bit near sighted, so I get a closer near focus at around 50 or 60 feet instead of the advertised 75 ft. My nikons near focus at 18 ft, not their advertised 28 ft.\n\nAs many other reviewers already said, the eyepiece barrels seem too big around, and pinch my nose if I try to get closer to the eyepiece. However, if I carefully measure the interpupilary distance, I can place them so I see the full field of view without the pinch. It just does not come as naturally as with my 10x50. I separated them to see if getting one eye closer would give a bigger field of view, but it did not. I guess how close I get is close enough. It just feels weird them being that far out on my nose and making that third point of contact like that. Edit: next day: I'm getting used to the new feeling.\n\nThe correct place to hold these binoculars is by the barrels in front of the prisms. That is how to get steadier views. Better yet, slouch down in a chair and put your elbows on the arm rests. Then all you'll see is your heart beat.\n\nI looked at a distant light, and compared its size to the Nikon's 16x. I find it very believable the Celestrons are 25x.\n\nThe field of view is not as wide as advertised. The apparent field of view is 57.4 degrees, not 61. The belt of Orion just barely fits in the view. The moon is 30% of the view. The true field of view is 2.4 degrees, not the advertised 2.7 degrees.\n\nThe arms of the eyepiece adjuster also have some wiggle in them causing a 1/4 inch delay when turning the adjuster wheel. I have had to re-adjust the right diopter even when I did not touch the center wheel, indicating it might be moving a bit. But it does not take long to get back into focus. There is also a flare visible off to the side of the exit pupil, though I don't see it during astronomy.\n\nDespite these flaws, I can't subtract a star at only $70 shipped. These binoculars are a league above my 10x50 for astronomical viewing, at least in terms of looking at individual targets. A telescope has many advantages, but these are grab and go. However, to see the phase of Venus, you need to stop down the aperture and sit down to brace your view.\n-------------------------\n\nI easily saw the correct shape of the Orion nebula on a half moon when my 10x50 could see nothing.\nI could see the dark side of the half moon, whereas my 10x50 could only see the bright side. My 16x50 also saw the dark side.\nJupiter looks much bigger in the 25x70, but I may need to reduce the aperture to see the stripes. I can see bands on Jupiter 114mm f8 Newtonian telescope at 28x, but I can't see bands at 25x in the binoculars.\nThe Pleiades look much better in the 25x70 than in the telescope or my other binoculars.\nThe double cluster in Perseus is clearly visible in the 25x70, and looks tiny with an almost stellar core in my 10x50.\nAndromeda, M31, looks better, with M32 and M110 noticeable by it, and very hard to see in my 10x50.\nI can see a tiny ring around Saturn at 28x in my telescope, but at 25x, I sometimes see a ring around Saturn and sometimes I don't. On the day that I could see a ring, my 16x50 detected ears.\nI can see M13 and other globular clusters as small fuzzy balls. I could find them in my 16x, but smaller. In my 10x, I can locate most of them, but they look like stars. Maybe I can detect a little fuzz on M13. In my 7x, I can't locate most of them, but I can see M13 and maybe a few others, though I don't remember.\nAll of my observing was hand held, unbraced.\nI could point them at whatever I wanted and hit my targets just fine. I had trouble hitting Andromeda right away because I could not see it naked eye.\nM82 and M81 are easy to identify in my 25x70 as I sweep over them. I can see the cigar shape of M82 in my 16x50 too, though I can't find either one in my 10x50.\nI can see a mountain range on the moon in the 25x70 when my elbows are braced. I've not yet found it in my 16x50.\nAirplanes look bigger but take longer to find in my 25x70.\nAt 25x, you can't tell where you are in the sky from the star orientations. You just have to point and look, and you know where you are when you see the object you are looking for. At 16x, I can pan around from bright star to bright star and figure out where I am by memory. At 10x, I can see some bright stars in the same field of view, but have to pan for others. And at 7x, you can easily see where you are.\nI actually think my view of M31 was more enjoyable in a 15x70 than in these 25x70, though I know the Orion nebula is better at 25x. It keeps getter better even at 60x.\nM33 can be located at lower power, but the 25x70 gave the best view, giving maybe a hint of spiral structure.",

        "content": "I love that my Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale is a great tool in my kitchen to help me measure food to ensure that I track what I’m putting into my body, my husband's and my children’s bodies each and every day, all day! It helps me measure food and ensure the quality control on everything. This food scale is my constant companion. I don’t eat without it. Now, don’t get me wrong. I didn't always use a food scale to measure my food intake. In fact, for years when I heard people talk about using a food scale, and measuring their food intake it was always dieters, and one thing I never went on was a diet. At least not in the sense I understood they meant to use the word, \"diet\"! The thought of depriving my body from food was foreign to me. In fact, growing up with a limited food supply meant that once I was old enough to get a job, I exiled food shortage from my life. However, overeating because food became plentiful in adulthood with a job eventually became a problem. Especially after pregnancy and becoming a mother. An experience worth losing a few vanity points over for sure! However, with weight gain vanity concerns pale in comparison to health concerns. You see, I needed to know for sure that I was eating what my body needed, and that I was feeding my husband and children what their bodies needed. And, if I began to tip over to overeating, I wanted it to be a conscious choice! And for my husband and children, I wanted to help them learn when to recognize that they were tipping over the point of eating the recommended daily calories from each food group so that I and so that they had awareness of when they had enough to do the job of sustaining a thriving body so we could experience the whole life change we were after as a family. This Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale plays a big part of helping us do that. All day, every day. It makes it easy. It takes just a second to put the food on it and measure the serving size. And I get to choose the units (ounces, grams, etc.).\n\nNow, I don't know about you, but I LOVE observing how people who work for companies in a support capacity do their jobs. And when I come across a person or staff that wows me, I stop and take notice! I also stop and take notice when I come across staff that has the opposite effect on me. And my follow through is just as thorough then as this review is now. The Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale support team wowed me! Immediately they responded to my inquiry when my scale, which I had for a long time, stopped working one day. Like I told you, this thing works hard all day every day measuring food for a family of four. Well, their support team instructed me on how to troubleshoot what was the cause of the problem, offered to send me a new scale, which arrived quickly, AND the piece de resistance. Several weeks later, they reached out to me to ask me how the new scale was working. Talk about a customer support team! Now that's the kind of service I want all day every day!\n\nSo, if you're considering buying a food scale for yourself and/or your family, I highly recommend the Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale. Not just because it's an amazing digital piece of machinery, but because the company has people, actual human beings who work there that care about the service they provide customers and it shows in the CRM (customer relationship management) system they very likely automated utilizing the beauty of digital technology to do it, but they also kept the human element present with their service, which gives them an extra edge.\n\nThis is my third Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale! It's a machine. It isn't meant to last forever. All machines eventually stop working. There's an expected life for every machine. And when this machine serves me till it can't anymore, like the last 2 did, I'll gratefully whisper a thank you for your service to the people who made it and gladly buy another one. Year after year. Etekcity and their customer team now have a \"raving fan\", as one of my favorite teachers and mentors calls it! When you get yours, let me know if you become a raving fan of the Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale too.",

This machine did come with Windows 11 installed, but I just finished going through all the updates (about 6 or so) to get to the latest version of Windows 11, and it runs ok. Also went through a dozen driver updates and everything works ok. I was concerned about 8 megs of RAM being enough for the software I use, and it's not, apparently, as that software runs but crashes after a while. Also, 256 GB of ssd storage is not enough. However, both those things are pretty easy to upgrade. Screen optical quality is very lackluster & I have been trying to tweak that in Windows with not much luck. I like the touch screen, track pad, keyboard feel. I like the power connector, seems sturdy and that's important to me, as I have regularly killed laptop power connections.

        "content": "Was a direct replacement for the Broan that I had. Wanted one with MORE suction CFM's but did not want to rework the entire exhaust duct system at this time. Looks nice, works well. Only complaint is where the sheet metal is formed and shaped at the front corners could/ should have been fitted better or spot welded as the seams are kind of open and allows cleaning cloth to get caught up on the metal corners. Otherwise, happy since it was a direct replacement which took me like 10 minutes to install :)) Longest part was swapping over the electrical plug. Plan to upgrade to a more powerful Broan or equivalent in the later part of the year. NOTE: Although identical, seems to be just a little quieter than the old one, just a bit low (200 CFM max) on the exhaust rating. Happy with the look and price till a higher CFM unit can be installed and, in our budget, :))",

        "content": "Update: It's been two years and the hood has worked flawlessly. I've had to buy a new range hood though because of a grease fire. This one is surprisingly still under $40 and I was so satisfied with the last one that I bought it again. Another reason for repurchasing this one is that I've already done all the preliminary work and it will slip right in. No figuring, cutting or buying additional parts. I'm sure I'll get more than two years out of this one as long as I don't burn my house down.\n\nOriginal review: The hood in the mobile home I purchased worked, but was beyond cleaning. I purchased this one as it fit perfectly in the space and it was very inexpensive. My mistake was not realizing that this unit has a seven inch exhaust when my old duct work was only five inches. I had to purchase a reducer and some metallic tape which solved the problem. I also purchased a seven inch damper as one does not come with this range hood and didn’t want to reuse the nasty one I pulled out of the five inch duct.\n\nThe metal on this hood is pretty thin, but for the price you can’t expect heavy duty. I recommend a two person install. The unit is not heavy, but is a little awkward to hold up and try to screw it in under your cabinets. If you drop it or bump it too hard you will damage it. The mounting points can be easily damaged if the hood is not held steady while installing. Once installed the odds of damaging it are slim.\n\nI made a template out of cardboard so I could cut a larger hole in the bottom of my cabinet with a jigsaw to accommodate the seven inch exhaust. I marked holes, drilled them and put screws in leaving the screws protruding so I could lift the hood up. I slid the keyholes onto the screws then tightened the screws. I had trouble holding the hood steady while tightening the screws and bent a couple of the screw keyholes in the top of the hood. After bending the keyholes back into reasonable shape, I took styrofoam from a different purchase and used it to hold the hood up. I added washers to the screws (after painting them gloss white) to give more strength to each of the four stress points were the screws go. My old hood was hard wired so I knocked out the plug in the back of the hood and ran the wire from the wall into the hood. (Prior to screwing the hood to the cabinets.) You have to remove one screw that holds the cover for the electrical components. Remove that cover, make your connections and put the cover back on. If you have an electrical outlet your need to plug into then you can just wire in a power cord rather than hard wiring the unit.\n\nThe hood came with four short screws to screw it to your cabinets. I had to come up with longer screws because these would be much too short. Mobile home remember? My cabinets are particle board including the bottom. Under the bottom there is a half inch of open space and then a layer of sheet rock. My screws needed to go through the sheet rock, through the open space and into the particle board. If you have nice cabinets made out of actual wood then the short screws should work for you just fine, but if you have nice cabinets you probably won’t be choosing this budget range hood.\n\nI’ve got the hood up and running. Some say it is loud when the fan is on high, but it’s a fact that my old fan was louder. (Mobil home. Built on the cheap.) I put a nice bright LED bulb in rather than that old incandescent bulb. My installation is low enough that you do not see underneath the hood at all. If I do look under there it looks much like the nasty old hood it replaced – just clean.\n\nMy hood arrived in pristine condition, but I can understand why so many people end up with dinged or damaged hoods. This is very light thin metal that will take damage easily. The install can be done alone, but would be easier with two people. A couple of the front seams on either end do shed a little light when I turn it on, but I wouldn’t have noticed it if I hadn’t read about it in another review and it’s only noticeable if I have the hood light on with the kitchen lights off. A dab or two of caulk or a piece of tape will fix that. It’s in a spot underneath where you’ll never see the tape anyway.\n\nThe front face of my cabinets hang down almost an eighth of an inch lower than the rest of the bottom of the cabinets so even though the front of the hood fits tight and flush to the cabinets, I do have this minor crack of a space between the hood and the cabinet bottom on the sides. Caulk it. I am happy with the hood. It looks much nicer than the ancient one it replaced and works great.\n\nI got this bad boy for only $40 although the price does fluctuate.",

        "content": "We replaced an identical one we had because our daughter used oven cleaner on the top and made the biggest mess you ever saw. The paint came up only partly leaving a sticky gooey mess that never went away. Worse than this, every dirty piece of lint, dust, bugs -- everything stuck to it. The nightmare from there is that all the aforementioned debris stuck so good, you could no way wash it off! All of this is not the to the detriment of this great item, of course.\n\nI love this hood's simple and functional design. It worked perfectly right up to the day we finally replaced it because of the above. It is not overly loud, no more than any other fan over the stove.\n\nWhat you need to know is this -- it does not come with the butterfly -- Broan BP87 Vertical Discharge Damper, 7-Inch. Be sure to get this item or you'll wait to get it before getting the install job finished. We just cleaned up the old one and reused it.\n\nAlso, the older version had a painted (black) electrical cover. I don't know if it matters, but save the old one (if this pertains) if you want the painted electrical cover. I opted to keep the new one which is lighter in weight and just the plain galvanized steel which is better looks-wise with the aluminum-colored vent screen. Not that it matters much as hopefully one doesn't spend much of their time looking up into their hood.\n\nIt's a thumbs up for function and long-lasting performance.\nOur old one with the ruined top was 28 years old -- still working perfectly.\n\nUpdate after installation. It is even more quiet than ever. Also, the new hood's front edge now has a lovely curve to it rather than the sharper angle on the older one. Very Nice!",

This really killed the device for me.\nEasy to overshoot if you used the finger swipe option to quickly move fast-forward or rewind.\nUser interface, for the most part is decent and fast except for how navigates while playing.\n\nFire TV\nBuilt to sell products instead of show shows, laggy, and for whatever reason I hated interacting with this device. Not being able to easily access the content I wanted due to poor organization really rubbed me the wrong way.\nPro - ability to bootleg shows, but not something I'm into and I only checked this out during the first weeks of covid.\nI want to emphasize the lag issues. This is built as cheap as possible to minimally meet requirements to function and it shows.\n\nRoku\nSo, now that I have the other devices out of the way, and ignore my LG streaming which is my favorite, I'll speak to this device and why it has my vote.\n\nThis device is surprisingly fast. I didn't expect a device that was almost as responsive as my apple TV and LG TV. This is slightly slower but barely and no lag which is the most critical thing for me.\nWe got this for the British Bake-off access which led to an unexpected cool thing. The discovery of the free shows, if you don't absolutely hate commercials. For the complete British Bake-off experience, we mute the commercials. So, the additional channels that Roku provides has made it continue to be useful.\nRoku allows a preview of channels as I fast forward through it.\nRoku does have an issues with some apps where I need to log out and go back in so the remote works correctly. I'm not sure if that's a bad app issue or the device but a quick back and in fixes. The apple device has never crashed or become buggy on me. The Firestick has, but it's cheap.\nThe price is significantly cheaper than apple making the Roku a no brainer.\nUnlike the apple TV, which requires counter space, this plugs into the back of the TV and is hidden away.\n\nNow, an issue I had when I first turned on is that my remote was not communicating with the device. I was extremely annoyed as this was an early Christmas present for my wife, and I wanted it to function within a certain time window so a return and replace would have ruined it. The device showed the remotes power but didn't communicate. After resetting the device, the remote works fine now. If you run into an issue, try resetting the device.\n\n4k streaming? It's okay. I didn't do a side by side. It has 4k.\n\nNavigation? It's simple enough but could be made better. I thought the last version of the Fire TV was worse. The apple TV does shine in this area on most apps I played with. My biggest gripe with navigation in Roku is that marking something as favorite and then LOCATING the favorites from Roku's channels and free shows, was not intuitive. I did eventually find my favorites, but that was frustrating. Additionally, the channel/app/inventory searching involves clicking to the right instead of down.\n\nSo, speed is slightly less than Apple, but barely. Navigation is slightly less easy based on the layout vs apple, and i think it's better than the Fire the last time I used that thing. The Roku has a nice access to misc. free channels. Its price is a quarter of Apple. The fire TV? I don't consider these two in the same league.\n\nSo, if you're picking up a streaming device, I'd recommend the Roku over the other devices (except the LG TV native streaming app which is the best I've used). Performance and price are good. The only reason to avoid is if it doesn't have access to what you want to watch. For me, it filled in the gaps and provided baking shows that we otherwise didn't have access to.",

        "content": "I’ve been using Roku boxes and sticks for years. They are consistently excellent at every function they perform. Their ability to stream without buffering, lost connection, or interruption beats all my “Smart” TV’s hands down. I have a number of Samsung TV’s that I buy for picture quality, and while most have built-in streaming function I have a Roku on each box. The reason is not just the better performance, but also to have a consistent user interface across multiple TV’s in my house. I have three Samsung smart TV’s of various ages, and all three have different user interfaces. Combine in a Vizio smart TV, with its own unique interface, and the learning curve is too much for many of the people in my house. I have 5 Roku units of varying ages, and they all have the same user interface. The new Roku sticks add TV power and volume control so you only need one remote. The Roku user interface is easy to learn, and organizes its presentation around the various streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Paramount+, etc.). Wirecutter tells me that the Google Chromecast might be the better adapter, because it organizes the interface around the shows you like to watch so you don’t need to remember which show is on which streaming service. I think the Roku is easy to use, and given that all our household TV consumers know the interface, I’m not anxious to change. Yet I agree that Google’s UI approach is interesting. But competition being what it is, I suspect Roku will release a similar function on their product at some point in the future.",

I'm using the Roku on an older Sony and I believe the max resolution 1080p. Doesn't need to be plugged into power adaptor, but when only plugged into a TV USB port the Roku may pause until the mini battery (probably a capacitor) in the charging USB cable charges up (a few seconds). The contents of the box include the adaptor, so I decided to use the adaptor. You can download the SPECTRUM app on this Roku, but I tried to load the Spectrum app on the Fire Stick and it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, although I did not try a pirated app, just legitimate downloads, and Apps2fire.\n\nCons: I tried setting up a new account, but when I logged out and tried to log back in my password wasn't recognized (or account), so I had to reset my password to log in, but it wouldn't recognize the new password. Next for a new account credit card info must be entered to progress (grrrr). Since I couldn't log in without resetting my password each time, I tried an old Roku account I had, and that worked fine (didn't even have to set up a credit card... Interface is not that intuitive in my opinion, I give the Fire Stick a nod to setup and interface.\n\nI bought this product and recommend it.",

This newer stick (model 3820) has one change in particular that made it almost unusable in my setup. I have a media hub that provides a stand alone wifi connection and an SD card slot. The media hub can provide a pass-thru internet connection (normally a hotspot from my phone) as well but most of the time does not have a network to connect to. Previous models of the Stick can read MP4 video files off the media hub card with the Roku Media Player regardless of pass-thru internet connection. This new model Stick WILL NOT READ THE SD CARD unless the media hub is connected to a network and provides it pass-thru to the Stick. Why? I don't know. I hope they fix it. I had to swap it with one of my previous gen sticks (model 3810 which was on my home wifi) to keep the functionality I needed.\n\nAlso, they made the power cord with built-in wifi longer (a few feet at least, and micro-usb). I see that as a plus for most people, but in my case, a shorter cable was preferred. The 3810 has a 1 foot cable with a mini-usb connection. They are not swappable between models because of the usb type. They should have kept the same connection so people could choose even if it meant a bit slower connection on the older shorter cable.",

Since our electronic devices have become ‘use and toss’ thanks to the constant upgrades, I figured I’d have to invest in a new smart TV. Luckily I saw an article about Roku and Firestick. I never understood what they were before. I decided to try the Firestick as it was $10 cheaper and if it didn’t work I wasn’t out that much. To my amazement it made my old TV new again. Now I can watch everything on all my streaming services, and much easier than before. Since that worked so great, I decided to get a Roku for the other television to see how it performed and it works great too. Roku has an easy to follow interface and it seems to work a little better than the Firestick interface, which doesn’t always show what was last watched for some reason. I like the remote better on the Firestick, because it is small and thinner, but this remote is good too, and if you have bigger hands you might prefer this one. One point is that the Firestick was not only $10 cheaper, it came with an HDMI extender, which you may need if your HDMI port is in a tight spot. Highly recommend either!",

They quickly started to get bored of not having anything to watch and asked me for help to try and find them a more cost-effective solution. I looked around and found this as an alternative to high monthly cable bills and decided to give it a go. The device itself has an easy setup and there aren't any visible cables sticking out from the back, making the room and TV mount area look less cluttered and easier to dust and clean. They like the fact that they can subscribe to only what they want to watch without having extra channels that they don't need, it makes finding content easier for them, and even get recommendations for other content that they might enjoy. They also really like that the TV goes into a \"screen saver\" mode when they step away for a bit but are able to pick right back up where they left off without interruptions. Their favorite feature is the remote and how easy navigating the content is with it. It's very user intuitive and can even control the volume on multiple devices with one remote automatically. The reason why the device is a bit finicky though is that it will suddenly freeze during an episode and the workaround can be a bit frustrating. Turning it off and on seemed to work at first, but then we found ourselves having to unplug the device itself from the TV and then plug it back in which becomes tedious when watching something suspenseful or scary and having to repeat the process over time. Overall, it's an okay device if you're looking to cut costs and get the job done.",

The stick is installed as an HDMI device and comes up running as soon as the TV is turned on. Also, there is no lag time whether it is changing the streaming service or changing the channel within the streaming service.

I have tried in it my parents simple Roku and it worked great but I noticed that my USB port doesn't give enough power to the Roku, and it started to shut down from time to time, the same was to this 4K roku. And I don't mind having to plug in the wifi cord into the ac power. BUT the wire is super short so I have to plug the USB with the wifi in the very corner, this way the USB and all the wires are visible, like, I should have saved $20 and bought the simple version. Also sometimes I turn the TV on and it doesn't recognize the Roku I have to unplug the wifi cable and then plug it again so the Roku SW starts, and tbh it's really annoying. After a 12 hrs shift sometimes all I want is get home, turn the TV on while I rest my body but now I have to move things around before so. Not to mention that I thought since it was more expensive the platform would be better but not. Roku needs to update their user experience, the apps have stars but I can't read the reviews on them. Also if the platform was customizable that would be awesome. At this point Roku you should hire me as a project engineer bcs you have lots of areas of opportunity.\n\nPros:\nAnyways, it gets the job done and that's why I'm not returning it. It does look very hd in my 53\" tv, it is faster than the simple Roku and once pluged into the ac it gets better and even faster. And later I'm gonna buy and extension so I can hide the wires. Would recommend? Maybe. If you have an ac power near your tv, and if you don't mind moving and etc. Also keep in mind that if your tv is old or even remotely old (mine is 7 y/o my parents TV is 4 y/o) and live in a hot environment with no Air conditioner it might get hot and shut down.",

I knew as fast as we go thru ice that ice trays weren’t going to cut it and always buying bags of ice gets old. I purchased this ice maker for $89 and all I can say is that this is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made! I filled it with water, plugged it in and it started making ice within about 15 minutes. You have a size choice for the ice cubes however even the large size isn’t huge but they don’t melt quick either. We used the ice as we normally would and what we didn’t use would eventually melt into the water reservoir to be frozen and reused again. I do have to add that the only noise the machine made was when it dropped ice into the basket and it wasn’t bothersome at all. It’s not a large machine so it doesn’t take up a lot of counter space which is always at a premium in a 5th wheel. Overall I’m very happy with this machine and highly recommend it, so much so that I’m buying the same machine for our home.",

        "content": "Pros: This little ice maker has been working nonstop for about 2.5 months and we're very pleased. It consistently produces ice every several minutes and recycles the water so it's very easy to use. We clean the interior with vinegar water and nothing else. It does not keep the ice cold like a freezer; however, just by leaving the lid closed and keeping the unit on there is always ice waiting on us. I generally put a little over 4 cups of water in twice or three times times a day if we're all using it (5 people) because we use a lot per person.\nAs far as noise, it is noticeable but not intrusive. We can talk at normal volume nearby without any issues. It was pretty easy to get used to the noise. I'd buy this again because it has easily paid for itself and is lots more convenient than driving to the store constantly for more ice.\n\nCons: the ice get soft quickly and even when it is freshly made it isn't a hard freeze. That's OK with us because it's so quick to produce another set of cubes but might pose a problem for others. You do also need to plan ahead when cleaning it because the drain plug is a touch awkward to reach if you're also trying to hold a bowl to catch the leftover water. I find it easier to carefully move it to a sink for draining.",

I simply fill with filtered water to the max waterline, plug the machine in, and select small or large ice size, and let it work. By the time I finish cooking lunch/dinner there is plenty of ice available. I do save any extra ice to put in the freezer in a separate ice bucket, but make sure to shake the ice bucket several times in a 10 minute period to break-up any clumps of ice that have frozen together. I do recommend this ice machine, and I would purchase this machine again. I love the aqua color also.",

When Ice lands in the tray after being made, it's going to make a noise. Most of all the refrigerators that has a built in ice maker that I've seen seems to be louder than this machine.\nI run the machine in the kitchen while I am in living room watching TV. Every once in a while I notice the sound of the ice being made falling into the ice tray. I catch my self wondering who's in the kitchen for a second before I realize it's the ice maker. The ice maker makes ice in two sizes. Bullet shaped with hole in one end. I like that. I usually make the small ice bullets. I ONLY USE SPRING WATER in this machine. No taste, other than clean tasting ice. I will not use tap water. I also make sure that the machine is completely dry when not being used. The one thing I do not like about the ice maker is the location of the drain plug. It's a plastic stopper under neath the front of the unit and you have to pull the ice maker over the edge of counter to open it to drain. The plug isn't easy to pull out and It feels awkward pulling it to the edge of counter so I can drain it. After I do drain it, when I am done making ice, I wipe it out with paper towel to ensure that it completely drys. Fresh tasting ice every time that way.",

Living in Phoenix where the tap water is sometimes 100 degrees, I've come to learn how important an ice maker can be.\n\nI go through a lot of ice.\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve with this device. I've learned, for instance, that I need to fill it every morning. If I do that, I can have a steady stream of ice all the time.\n\nI've learned that the machine works better if you get a piece of Styrofoam and cut it so it fits in the lid. I realize that this isn't a freezer, and it's not designed to keep ice frozen. I have found that the extra insulation causes it to run less often.\n\nI do wish that the bin was larger. I go through about a tan of water on this thing a day, and I'm the only one using it. If you have more than one person using the ice from this, it's probably not going to be very well suited for your purposes. But if you are using ice for a specific purpose or if you are the only one using it, I think it's a great little device.\n\nOf course, the primary issue is that taking a single step up on a more powerful machine will triple the price, so this is about as good as it's going to get.",

The only one in my family that really uses ice is my wife. Makes plenty for her. If you want something for more than 2 people I'd recommend getting a larger one, or storing the ice it makes in the freezer.\n\nAll-in-all it works perfect for what I needed it for.",

The only drawback (if there is one) is that you might have to wait for the ink to dry as it is more of a wet variety (as mentioned).\n\nOne last thing. Since the ink is of a wet variety, it can \"bleed\" through paper, so keep that in mind.",

        "content": "I bought Roku Express when my satellite provider raised prices beyond my tolerance level. I needed to also subscribe to YouTube TV to get access to the channels I wanted, but it was still half the price of satellite. First the cons: The adhesive tape provided for attaching the unit to a TV is useless. This is probably only an issue if your TV is wall-mounted, but mine is. Another wall mount issue, the plug from the unit is too big to fit between the TV and the wall. I had to buy a 1' extension cord with a flat plug, which did solve the problem. Finally, for some reason my TV accessibility settings periodically change on their own. This never happened before I started using the Roku remote. I need to get the LG remote to successfully restore the settings.\nNow the pros: The primary advantage for me is cost, even though I added a YouTube subscription. Plus, there are plenty of free services you can add. Roku even has some original programming that I have enjoyed. Also, the picture quality is vastly superior to the satellite picture quality. And the volume is louder. The remote is easy to use.\nOverall, I am satisfied with this purchase.",

I'm writing this review to help others who may have the same set up \"problem\" that I had. My 1st Roku experience was with a Roku TV - so minimal set up. This Roku box required that I follow on-screen instructions, but the TV screen was set to enlarge the screen (previously used with Dish network). The on-screen commands I needed to see were outside the viewing range because of the screen setting. I was able to see just enough of the on-screen instructions that I thought I was clicking the right buttons on the remote. I decided the product was defective because the box didn't appear to respond to the remote control (the Roku box was waiting for me to make the right response). I even changed the batteries in the remote control. I sent it all back to Amazon. When I rec'd the new one, it also \"didn't work\". This time I tried it out on a TV in the basement. Easy set up, worked perfect, great picture. Eventually I figured out the problem on the other TV was the screen setting.",

I purchased this one to replace an original to take advantage of some improved specs and features.\n\nOne of the new features I like is the ability to listen through a mobile device. This allows you to use a headset. Two shortcomings of note: 1) Enabling audio through the mobile app disables audio through the TV. I wish this was optional. Like many people my age, I like a headset to hear all the dialog, but I don't always want to shut out other people in the room. 2) Audio cuts in and out when using the Roku app on my Samsung/Android phone. It works perfectly through my iPad.\n\nThis Roku works only via wifi. I'm old school and prefer wired for high bandwidth devices. But that's probably not necessary anymore, the wifi has worked fine, and I didn't mark the review down for it.",

However, if you are going to use one for viewing TV from a HDHomeRun Network TV tuner, you need to either get the 2020 Ultra or newer, or buy a different brand streaming device. It turns out most Rokus can not decode the audio from a HDHomeRun tuner per HDHomeRun tech support. They implied that it could work with a newer TV, but as I experienced it did not work with my older TV nor a computer monitor, since neither could decode the audio either. The HDHomerun support team suggested to use a sound bar or surround sound AVR instead.\n\nUpdate Jan 26th.\nI have had more opportunity to use the this Roku device. I have found that the WiFi streaming works well. The router and this Roku are located at opposite rooms and floors in the house. I did not have any issues with dropped connections and the like.\n\nI feel the Rokus have the most comprehensive ecosystems of the the three manufacturers of these devices that I own, that being the Rokus, AppleTV, and the Firestick. This said, the AppleTV has a more polished look and feel, and are much improved over the older AppleTV models.\n\nIf you can only afford one of these I recommend going with the top of the line Roku Ultras. That is, unless you are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem. Then perhaps the AppleTV will serve you better. The top end Roku Ultras have the ability to use a wired connection, and are compatible with the HDHomeRun, whereas the lessor models are not.",

I was using a water filtration pitcher that required changing roughly every two weeks with a filter that cost about $10!!\n\nIn terms of flavor, we have city water that when unfiltered does taste like chlorine. This removed the chlorine flavor. My mom is super picky about any chlorine taste in her water. I don’t always notice if a filter isn’t working as well, but she would definitely comment on my water flavor if I didn’t change the filter quick enough when I was using a filtering pitcher.

I have a large undersink filter in my kitchen and this filter installed in the refrigerator.\n\nWhen I test my prefiltered water PPM it swings from 100 to upwards of 150 PPM, and I've seen it go higher on occasion as well. When testing the large undersink and this refrigerator filtered water they are both consistently 100 PPM. The reason I keep buying them is because at times when our water is worse, these filters keep the PPM stable at a decent number.\n\nI can also attest that my refrigerator ice maker will not function when the filter is close to end of life. I was curious is that was happening because it was aware when the filter was expiring, so I chose to not \"reset\" the filter when I replaced it last and the ice maker started working again.\n\nThat all being said, this filter checks all my boxes, keeps everyone happy with ice making and keeps my organic soil chlorine free and happy as well :)",

They used to have caps on them but now they are retractable. They seem to work just as well. The ink flows smoothly and evenly and does not leave blobs. My writing looks neater when I use these pens. I am left handed and occasionally drag my hand over what I’ve written but these have never smudged. I’ve been using Papermate pens since the 1980’s and they do not disappoint.",

It can be a little tricky to remove in case you need to clean under it (water will get inside of it and when that happens you’ll need to dry it with a cloth or a shirt tail or something). I have broken one taking it off to clean underneath the glass but that was when I first got them and wasn’t super familiar with taking them off. Now it doesn’t ever happen unless the glass is already good and cracked.\n\nPutting it on can be a bit tricky but once you’ve done it a couple times it becomes super easy.\n\nProtection feels like it is very high. My watch looks brand new underneath the glass. I keep a couple in the drawer for backup. I work with my hands a lot, digging ditches, installing water lines, plumbing and bang my hands up OFTEN. I’ve cracked the glass protector plenty of times but the watch itself has taken next to 0 damage.\n\nThe crown of the watch is exposed and mine is showing very slight wear, but unless you’re rough on your watches, this shouldn’t be an issue. I’m likely on the “rougher” end of the spectrum when it comes to watch use. Anybody on the “lighter” end shouldn’t have any issue with the crown scuffing.",

Its not like your typical gorilla glass phone screen protector that adheres its self to the stock glass.\nThis touches but not air tight. If you submerge it, you’ll get moisture trapped between them which makes the watch spaz out til its dry.\nI take off my watch to shower and don’t experience that issue anymore.\nAlso, i read some folks complain that the protector shatters if you remove it, but iv taken mine off to clean it atleast a dozen times since november 2022 and its end of January now. Gently lift the non button side slowly and she’ll pop right off. Gently rinse the cover with some soapy water and dry out the inside, then snap it back on.\nI love mine. Guys at work got them now to and unfortunately were able to test them for damage.\nWorks as advertised and keeps your apple watch face from getting shattered.\n\nYou’ll lose a tiny bit of touch sensitivity and the edges are a little harder to get at but, all in all….. an absolute Great product for those of use that are rough on electronics and devices.",

In fact, lack of face protection is what actually killed my Fitbit, so I opted for the Apple SE watch as a replacement. It also was not protected but did off an option which is this product, a face protection clip-on piece. It is inexpensive insurance, very easy to affix to the face of the watch and the touch screen still operates very effectively. The protector does not hinder any intended function of the watch. The only reason I did not give it five stars all the way is that I have not used it long enough to attest to its scratchproofness. Quite inexpensive, very easy to clip on, and highly effective.",

It fits nearly like a glove; you can tap on it with your finger and hear a slight rattle/some give, but it stays securely in place while wearing and working out. I’ve worn it a few of weeks and it has a few small scratches, so it isn’t scratch-proof, but better this gets scratched than my watch face. My issue with this is how I have to tap the screen more than once to engage a function; rarely does it work like it would without this protector. It’s a slight hassle and shows that this does not fit like a glove. I like how it protects around the edges of the watch because I’ve dropped mine and the edge was where mine made contact with the travertine, damaging the glass along the edge. This should prevent that from happening again. If this would have been more touch-sensitive, I would’ve given it 5 stars.",

I’ve never seen a touch issue like this before!\n\nIf you are someone who types messages from your watch, you need to think before buying this case!\n\nUpdate:\nI changed from 3 to 4 stars. I found a solution to the touch screen issue. If I remove the case and wipe it with microfiber cloth, the touch response is better for a few days.

    "description": "Product Description\n\nThe BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle is built off the design of the iconic BlenderBottle Classic, with an upgraded look, and feature updates—including a rounded base and SpoutGuard—that make it easy to maintain proper nutrition on-the-go. The patented mixing system—with a 316 surgical-grade stainless steel BlenderBall wire whisk that moves inside the bottle to smooth out mixes—makes it ideal for protein shakes, smoothies, fiber drinks, and meal replacements. A wide mouth makes it easy to add ingredients, and the rounded base ensures thorough mixing and easy cleanup. Bottle contents and liquids are securely contained by a tightly threaded screw-on lid that creates a leakproof seal, and an ergonomic flip cap that snaps securely shut for shaking and transportation (fits in most cupholders). A SpoutGuard makes it possible to open the flip top without touching the drinking spout, to keep the mouthpiece clean. Embossed markings show both ounces and milliliters for easy measuring. The BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle can also be used as a water bottle. Available in three sizes: 20-Ounce (measurements go to 14 ounces), 28-Ounce (measurements go to 22 ounces), and 45-Ounce (measurements go to 34 ounces). BPA- and phthalate-free. Top-rack dishwasher safe. Manufacturer’s limited lifetime warranty.",

        "content": "I've been eating super healthy for the past 2 years but THIS year decided to really buckle down, lose weight, gain muscle, get energy, feel good, be happy. I'm doing a lot of clean eating, cardio, strength training and rucking.\n\nI love protein shakes because they are a nice way to get in some protein, taste good and are EASY to make. My problem is is that I wake up super early and my blender, albeit awesome, is LOUD AS HECK. Instead of waking the dead, I decided to get a shaker cup.\n\n1- Size: This might be too small for some people. Originally I was doing 2 cups of almond milk, spinach, carrots, raspberries, orgain, MCT oil, matcha and chlorophyll. While super duper healthy, I wanted to stop drinking my calories and do one cup of almond milk. I cut everything and ended up with chlorophyll, orgain and ONE cup of almond milk. That makes this size of a shaker perfect for me. Even if I decided to do 2cups of milk, this would still be a good size.\n\n2- PRICE: To be 100% transparent, there is TWO (maybe more) listings for this specific shaker/brand. I orignally purchased the one that is $1.20 cheaper in a color I didn't really LOVE and just LIKED. I realized about 30 seconds later (I'm working on my ADHD lol) that THIS listing had MORE colors and colors I LOVED, was $1.20 MORE and came with the metal thingy, so I cancelled the other one and got this one. Price is good. $1.20 more for a metal thingy is nice and I love the color I bought.\n\n3- Color: The FIRST one I got was like Teal. Cool. It's blue, I love blue. BUT, I love this blue better baby :o)\n\nThis is navy blue, true to color, kinda dark, I love it a lot.\n\n4- Leak Proof: I mean I work from home, workout at home, eat at home. I am not a gym rat. Maybe eventually I will venture outwards among the peoples but for now I am in my house. I DON'T know if this is 100% leakproof. Here is what I do know:\n\n- The \"drink part\" has that plastic part that comes down and CLICKS so you can HEAR it locking properly. I use the term \"locking\" loosely. But it is a nice tight close. I still kept my finger on it because I have trust issues from other cups lol. But, I shook it a lot and it stayed closed.\n\n- It's a fatty and a shorty. Fat and short cups = stability.\n\nOverall it was under $10, I love the color and size, it can go in the dishwasher (top rack, dude) and it's a thick plastic.\n\nTip: For my new shaker peoples: Don't shake and drink. If you're using protein powder, go do something else for a few minutes. When i use the blender with orgain it has more RPM than my arm so it blends everything PERFECT. I can make it, blend it, drink it. With this shaker I let it sit for 2-5 min and those little pieces should dissolve and make it not so \"grainy\" for lack of a better term.",

        "content": "It shows when a product has had thought put into its design. There are a lot of little things about this bottle that you start to notice:\n\n- The wire ball is a great idea and does a fantastic job of mixing. It's light years ahead of putting a spoon in a glass and stirring.\n- The bottom of the cup is spherical to match the mixing ball so that it doesn't leave any unmixed portion.\n- The spout hinge closes very tightly to prevent leaks, but there is a large ledge for your thumbs to grasp from underneath to pop it open it easily.\n- The spout hinge has enough friction to stay open without flapping around, so it doesn't hit you in the cheek when you drink from the spout.\n- The sides have indents that act as reliefs to add grip so that when you screw down the lid, you have something to hold onto, ensuring that it closes tightly with no leaks.\n- The edges of the pour spot are nicely rounded off so they feel comfortable on the lips, and the diameter is just right for drinking -- if you want to chug your drink quickly, there's enough room for air to get past to prevent restrictions, but you can also sip comfortably.\n- The mouth of the bottle with the lid removed is quite wide, and very convenient for dumping drink mix or other ingredients without missing and making a mess.\n- There's a convenient folding loop for carrying the bottle with one finger if your hands are full.\n- It's just the right size, not tiny and not gigantic.\n\nThe only minor annoyance that I experienced was that I tended to get the wire mixing ball stuck on things when setting it out to dry (such as the wire sides of a dish drying rack.) That's easy enough to work around.\n\nTLDR: If you are doing any kind of powder drink mix and you don't have one of these, you're missing out.",

        "content": "I have this item and a larger one of the same brand. They work really well for blending the contents inside so that the liquid is smooth. I use them for almond milk with protein powder added. A few sturdy shakes and the liquid is blended well and ready to drink without lumps of the protein powder. Also add some dried peanut butter powder sometimes to make it taste more like a dessert.\n\nCup lid seals tight and the only leak I've had was the few times I was an idiot and neglected to click the lid tightly into its sealed position. Otherwise, properly sealed and turned snugly, the lid keeps all the liquid inside.\n\nThe only complaint I'd make is that the metering on the side of the cup is practically impossible to read. I'm thinking that I'll use a permanent marker to highlight some of the common size meter markings so that I don't have to struggle to see them daily.",

        "content": "I bought the blender bottle when it first came our years and years ago. I wasn't a fan. It of course was better than shaking protein powders in a water bottle or stirring with a spoon, but the flat bottom prevented a lot of the powder from blending completely. This V2 blender bottle has a curved bottom which allows the whisk ball to get all the powder that settles to the bottom. No joke I only have to shake for maybe 10-15 seconds to get a perfectly blended shake. It is awesome. The only reason I took a star away is because I really wish that they would find a way to make a glass/stainless steel option. I dislike plastic because eventually it will take on the smell and taste of either the dishwasher pods or protein shake if you don't immediately rinse it out. A small complaint and I feel that this V2 version is definitely worth it!",

I had a feeling it was the style of the \"blender\" that was inside, so I decided to order this one. I have NO issues with this whatsoever! It blends extremely well and eliminates nearly all clumps (I get a few small ones here and there) and it takes me 1/3rd of the time to shake it and achieve that smoothness. My other shaker was a workout in itself lol. I have also noticed NO leaks, it's very easy to hold (I have small hands), and this comes in a bunch of colors! The only downside, which isn't really anything to do with the cup, is that it came with a giveaway QR code inside that apparently is already over so I wasn't able to participate in that.",

That might sound like a negative but trust when I say I have used close to a dozen different shaker bottles and all the ones with o-rings leak if they aren't screwed on a specific way. This one seems to just create a great seal just from pressure which constant use for the last week has proven reliable. I don't use the shaker ball so can not speak to that.\n\nThe rubberized hook/handle has a nice feel and is a nice size. I've had others with huge caribener style rings that are handy but often get in the way.\n\nthe hinge is also very sturdy compared to most shaker bottles.\n\nif you're looking for a shaker bottle.

        "content": "These are great kitchen trash bags especially them being black kitchen trash bags I never knew that black kitchen trash bags until I believe last year in the beginning of 2021 and also I think this is the only brand that makes black kitchen trash bags I wish they would come out with more types of black kitchen trash bags like they do have so many different varieties in the white kitchen trash bags I love it that they're black because with the white ones you could see through the bags and see all the yucky rubbish that's been accumulated throughout the day and to me it was nasty seeing left over or spoiled food smudged onto the inside of the bag and depending how full the bag got and it's durability when taking out the trash and seeing that mess always worried that the bag was gonna split open and sometimes that's exactly what happened and then having to end cleaning and mopping up the whole kitchen from the old spoiled leftovers or chicken bones and grease from the pan and please don't bring up the stench that old food left behind then having to clean the whole kitchen trash bag out with the hose and some dish soap then either having to wait for it to dry or finding some old rag to dry it so you could put a new trash bag in and be able to use your kitchen trash can so yeah since I discovered these black bags I've been very satisfied only thing I wish like I said earlier is that wish they had more of a variety to choose the strength and also fragrance of the bag oh my maybe someday I think I'm going to wrote different companies that make trash bags and request for them to make more of a selection on black kitchen trash bags it's a thought I don't know how long these kitchen trash bags have been on the market but it makes me wonder why other brands haven't made their own style of black kitchen trash bags well I will email all the different brands and suggest they make some cause I know there's a lot of other people out there in the world that would and do perfer black bags over white for their kitchen trash can well that's all I've got to say this is my first review I didn't know you could leave reviews about your purchases this one juss popped up when I opened my Amazon account",

We then went to the hospital where I stayed overnight with my wife and new baby girl. The next day, once things had clamed down, I went home to clean up before they came home. For those who have witnessed or gone through child birth, you know what a mess I arrived to. For those who haven't, suffice to say there are many different types of fluids and a lot of them. Let's just say I was fully expecting to be purchasing a new mattress. To my amazement, once I'd bagged our sheets and this mattress pad, our mattress was perfectly fine. I bought another one immediately and will continue to use this brand as long as it exists. I challenge anyone to put it through a more rigorous test and I'm positive it can stand up to some sweat or your child's pee in the middle of the night. I could have posted a pic but it's better for everyone if I don't.",

        "content": "I had high hopes for this mattress topper. I'm using it to protect a queen-sized 3\" memory foam topper for my bed against my beloved nemesis: a 5 kg cat.\n\nWhen my feline companion suffered from an unwelcome malady, she found comfort on my month-old memory foam mattress topper, 3-week-old down duvet (dry-clean only, of course) and brand spanking new blanket. She decided to prance over and urinate several gallons atop me and my partner. Twice in a week. The so-called \"waterproof mattress cover\" I owned at the time of the first incident, and the other brand I purchased from a large store with a red circle after the second, did not live up to one small cat's piddle. They soaked through, ruined the comforter and memory foam topper, and left us thoroughly pissed.\n\nThis cover fits great over the memory foam topper, though the corners are a bit snug to the topper. They tend to pull it up, and I assume that's because most mattresses have rounded corners or the depth of the mattress pulls the sheet down. I'm working with 3\" thickness, which leaves plenty of material snug beneath the topper for a solid fit. The terrycloth-like surface of the waterproof part fully covers the topper. Better yet, it feels soft and gives off very little sound whenever we sit or lie on it. I'm leery of anything that produces a lot of noise at night and this certainly doesn't.\n\nI wouldn't expect this to hold up to a ton of liquid for a long time, but it definitely seems to resist sweat and small amounts so far. And don't worry - kitty's been seen by the vet and hopefully won't repeat her bed-ruining antics again.",

After 2 - 3 weeks, I asked my teen how it was holding up and was told, “It’s fine” — That is Teenspeak for: “Dad, it is amazingly comfortable and problem free to the point where I haven’t even noticed that it was there. Thank you getting such a thoughtful gift for me!”\n\nI can see where this would be an excellent item to purchase for your college bound kids (who knows what was done to that dorm mattress before your child gets it?) I remember sometimes being too lazy to put sheets on my dorm mattress and just sleeping wrapped in a blanket - is it too late for a tetanus shot?\n\nYour child may not care what they sleep on but you do.

It’s like a book but thicker obviously not the front or the back but the pages in between and it’s really sensitive. If you touch any of the pictures it will tell you what it is. It makes noises it’s very educational there’s different settings. I am really impressed with this especially for this price. Definitely a great Amazon find and I feel like my toddler could easily play with us from now until she’s at least three or even four years old.

It’s been about a year now and they still love them and are always excited to see them since it’s not an everyday toy they play with. As they’ve gotten older they now try to repeat the words more. I love the Spanish version built in as it exposes my kids to even more Spanish than they are already getting. Bring in the car, road trip, doctors appointments or anywhere your little one is needing to give you a break and for them to play. Also, great 1-3 yr old gift",

        "content": "Fits perfect. I recently bought a new bed mattress for myself, and my father, and have noticed that some of the older sheets that normally sit on the mattress were too loose or when you lay on them, the sides un pinch them selves or barely hold on (overly loose).\n\nKeep in mind that my old mattress was a standard classic mattress from at least 22 years ago.\n\nAll the new mattresses they sell now are a hybrid or gel and tend to be either 14 inches or 12 inches sometimes even smaller or higher depending on the variety. If you’re like me, it’s easier to buy the bed sheet for the exact size of the mattress if you buy these.\n\nFor example, a queen bed would get a queen mattress covers, but make sure the bed sheet can wraparound precisely on the mattress size.\n\nTry to avoid, for example a 14 inch, that can accommodate an 18 or 17 inches 'deep pockets'. Through personal error, I have found out there either too loose, shift constantly, or they slide loose and sometimes they’re not tight so it ends up overly loose in the center.\n\nThese bedsheets from Amazon are perfect. Tightly wraparound and hold on almost like stockings. I very rarely have to slightly push it to the side from the middle after using it for a week it’s retaining structure. Very happy with it and they don’t break the bank either. Nothing negative to say they are a little bit see-through probably 5 to 10% but nothing major.\n\nUPDATED: 2/17/2023\n\nEverything I said in the review is still stands, has not come undone. The bed that I have the image is a hybrid 14inch. It has mini coils (3 inches) the rest is a foam/gel type liquid contouring type of bed. (soft top/medium firmness). Stayed on perfectly after I decided to wash the covers.\n\nI then remove the same cover from my dad's bed and noticed that it was only very tiny lifted in the portion where he was sleeping, but did not come undone. His is a 12 inch version of this one but it's 100% contouring type of bed that molds towards the body, so obviously it constantly shifts with movement.\n\nIt stayed on, never came undone and no longer slides off by one of the sides and ends in random places. Very happy with it! Yes. buy the exact type of size mattress cover and avoid the deep pocket variety or the kind that say they can handle your mattress size, but go 3 to 4 inches more.\n\nThose are better for classic bed spring.\n\nNewer bed factors play a role like pure gel/foam/hybrid etc. Using common sense, the constant shifting and contouring toward the body of anyone on the bed moves around little by little the softer it goes. A lot of deep pocket variety don't have a string you can pull if you have a 12/14 inch newer mattress.\n\nVery happy I don't have to waste time every morning now because it slid off on one side or came almost completely undone in the center, instead, I can just do a tiny touchup on top by hand, (flattening) pinching the sides (or where its needed). But rarely needed. I have also slept on the bed a few days with just the new sheet covers (no flat-sheet/comforter or pillows) and they still don't come undone. Great product.",

        "content": "For two years. Two years I suffered in silence. Yes. I.... I a struggling young adult struggled with only one... Yes that's right ONE set of sheets. Every week it was the same. Strip the bed. Wash the sheets, dry the sheets, remake the bed. Over the 2 years my one poor set of sheets took a beating. They saw countless menstrual cycles, various cold and flue viruses, dogs, and sleep overs. I meticulously washed and bleached those sheets until one day I took them from the wash and noted that they were beyond bleaching or stain removal. There were dying.... They were dying gray.\n\nI searched high and low. Went to target and TJ Maxx... But to no avail. Why... Why were simple square pieces of fabric $50.00!?!?!? I could not afford this. I could not justify the spending of $50.00 on plain white fabric. So I searched. I searched high and I searched low Until I came here...\nTo The Amazon.\n\nIt was here. Here I discovered them. Plain white sheets at a modest and affordable price.\n\"Don't buy them! You'll regret it! You need Egyptian cotton!\" My mother said.\n\n\"No! I care not what cotton they be! All I need are sheets! I have no one to impress! No one who shares my bed! I am a lowly virgin promised in matrimony to another with a sworn vow of chastity! I care not for fancy sheets!\" I shouted.\n\nSo I bought them. I made my bed and I laid in it. And I can tell you that yes... They are I fact sheets that you can sleep in.",

        "content": "First, I love the color (spa blue). I really prefer crisp white percale sheets, but that doesn't work for my husband (he sweats a lot at night, so white sheets become yellow rather quickly). For whatever reason, I can't seem to find nice percale sheets like my grandma used to have. She never wasted money on high thread count, but her sheets were also crisp and fresh and smooth. All the sheets I have tried over the years end up being rough or they pill or they wrinkle. I had one set that I loved the feel of, but the top sheet would NOT ever give me a nice clean edge, even if I ironed it. So when we bought our new king-size bed and had to upgrade all our queen size bedding, I decided to take a chance on these microfiber sheets. They are thinner than I expected, but they seem to be sturdy, I hope. Only time will really tell. They washed up beautifully, and when I pulled them out of the dryer (TBH, it was 3 days later), there wasn't a wrinkle to be seen and no pilling. When we put the fitted sheet on the bed, it fit snugly, exactly as it is supposed to, without a wrinkle and without any loose sections that tend to annoy me when I'm in bed at night. The top sheet fit well, but I wish it were longer. The sides drape just right, but the length didn't give me much to tuck under the end of the bed, which is actually very important to me, as my husband is a rough sleeper and tends to pull sheets and blankets out if they aren't well-tucked. The pillowcases are much larger than I expected. We have good quality thick bamboo pillows that are dwarfed by these cases' length (probably extra 6 inches or more hanging loose at the end of the pillow), but they fit the pillows properly in every other regard, nice and smooth, snug without being tight. The sheets are smooth and soft. Not percale crisp, but a nice softness that might just convince me to give up on the percale dream. They also don't have that weird microfiber feel that so many others have (can't really describe it, but it just doesn't feel natural to me). I only have 2 complaints, and they are fairly minor. The biggest complaint is that the bottom sheet fits well, but it doesn't stay in place. Woke up in the morning with the sheet completely off in one corner. I'm hoping that it is just that we didn't get it on quite right the first time and maybe it will hold up better in the future, or maybe I'm going to have to invest in some straps to hold the corners in place better. The other complaint is more like a suggestion. our last set of sheets had a small tag on the fitted sheet that said \"Top or Bottom\" so we always knew which way to put it on the bed. Queen sheets were easier to identify ends from sides (obvious rectangle), as the king sheets are closer to square and harder to identify ends. We had to put the sheet on and try it, then pull it off and turn it before we knew the correct placement. I will put some kind of mark on it myself for future placement, but it would sure be nice if the manufacturer would include that tag from the get-go.",

I’m still on the lookout, I don’t want to pull the $200 trigger on the real deal just yet.\n\nDespite not being what I wanted, it’s a comfortable and well-made sheet set. A good option if looking for a more cotton-like set feel that is wrinkle-resistant. They don’t feel cheaply made, quality stitching, and not ultra-thin.\n\nWorth noting:\n\n- They do have a slight satin-like sheen to them; and\n\n- The “dark gray” set might look like a super-light gray in the photos, but it’s much darker in reality - and has a somewhat green tinge to them, not unlike the cotton set they offer. Be prepared for the color to be quite different.\n\nTL;DR: Altogether a solid set, however (1) they’re absolutely nothing at all like Sheex, despite some reviews comparing the two, (2) avoid if a mild shine is a dealbreaker, and (3) dark gray is not light gray as depicted, but actually dark gray/green.",

We over-engineered these double-wall insulated tumblers with an 18/8 stainless steel body, which means your drink still keeps its temperature no matter how much of a beating this cup takes. They’re BPA-free (obviously), have a No Sweat Design to make sure your hands stay dry, and are dishwasher-safe. Plus its crystal-clear lid lets you check your drink status in a flash. Refill, anyone?\n\nThe YETI 20 oz Rambler Tumbler stands 6 7/8 in high and has a lip diameter of 3 1/2 in. All YETI Tumblers are sized to fit in standard sized cup holders.\n\n18/8 STAINLESS STEEL Made with kitchen-grade stainless steel, so they’re puncture- and rust-resistant.\n\nDOUBLE-WALL VACUUM INSULATION Keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot until the last sip.\n\nNO SWEAT DESIGN Keeps fingers dry and unfrostbitten.\n\nMAGSLIDER LID\n\nThe MagSlider Lid means enjoying a hot drink from our Rambler Tumblers without worrying about splashes on the go. Unlike other closeable drink lids, ours harness the power of magnets (yep, real magnets) for smooth opening and closing, and has a crystal clear lid so you can always see if you’re in need of a top off. Our magnet technology also makes for easy cleaning — you can pop the MagSlider off, rinse, dry, and return it to the YETI Slider Lid. And the MagSlider Lid is spill- and shatter-resistant, just like the rest of our Rambler accessories. Dishwasher-safe.",

The reason this is my favorite size is because it easily fits in my car and couch drink holders, is easy to hold and isn’t big and bulky. I do not personally feel like I need to carry my entire days worth of beverage around at one time. I can refill as necessary! I also like to change between flavored waters during the day and coffee in the mornings so this is the perfect size tumbler to handle all my needs. As for the purple…. I was a little nervous about getting the purple but I’m so glad I did! I really like the shade and I’ve received several compliments on the color. The lid fits nicely and isn’t impossible to get off. The sliding drink closure in the lid is really nice but it is NOT leakproof so be careful not to let the tumbler fall over because it will leak! Although this style of lid will leak, it’s still my lid style of choice! Another plus is that this tumbler design allows for easy cleaning.",

My only complaint is that the sliding part that closes the mug is not totally leak proof. I would not recommend throwing this mug into a bag because it will leak all over.

The photos don’t do it justice.\n\nSince the 20 oz is the perfect size for 2 cups of coffee and I prefer my homemade coffee over the coffee my job has, my yeti has become an everyday staple for me. It fits well enough in my car’s cup holder and can withstand some turbulence. Furthermore, the magnetic slider makes it really easy to sneak in a few sips of coffee while waiting at a stop light while commuting to work. I also love using it at home for coffee or a double batch of tea.\n\nLastly, I love that it’s dishwasher safe! While I don’t always use a dishwasher to clean my Yeti, I appreciate having the option to throw it in there if I don’t feel like hand washing it.\n\n5/5 stars.

We had an exhaust tube & power outlet in the cabinet above the stove, so the fan needed a power cord which isn't included in the package. My partner picked one up from Home Depot & cut it down to the necessary length, then attached it to the wires. Given his experience with electrical devices the installation was quick & easy. The fan works great, but the light didn't work at the same time with a 75 watt bulb. When we replaced the bulb with a 40 watt bulb both the fan & light worked just fine. This looks so much cleaner than the ugly white microwave that was too large for that space anyway. We're happier with our counter-top combo microwave/airfryer which we also purchased from Amazon.",

        "content": "There really isn't much to say about this Thermos. It's your basic Thermos, with the usual Thermos ability to keep cold food cold and hot food hot. This particular model has a neat spoon compartment (with folded-up spoon included in the compartment clip) as well. While we don't use the spoon very much, it's neat and seems decently durable. (I'm not sure how one would go about replacing a lost or damaged one, though that may be a consideration at some point...) Clean-up is easy, and if you've had a Thermos before you know the key (for best results) is to clean your Thermos as soon as possible after you get home. There aren't a lot of moving parts besides the inner ring you can pop out and wash. I use a small cleaning brush to get into the top efficiently and have no issues. The spoon compartment is part of the top of the Thermos, and has a pop hinge. Water definitely can get in during cleaning, so you do have to make sure that you rinse that section and dry it thoroughly -- and the spoon, if you keep it in there -- whenever you clean the Thermos.\n\nThat all said, I'm really happy with the purchase. It's perfect for a decent-sized lunch entree or soup, and my favorite part is the striking metallic blue color of it, which just makes me feel good to look at. You really can't go wrong with a Thermos-brand insulated food container, and not only did I have no issues purchasing this one, I'm thoroughly pleased with my purchase and will no doubt be buying more in the future.",

The mat measures 74 x 24 inches and is made from high-density foam, which provides extra cushioning and support for joints.\n\nOne of the things I really like about this mat is its thickness. The 1/2-inch foam provides excellent cushioning and support for the joints, making it a great option for those who have sensitive knees, wrists, or ankles.(My cat loves it LOL) The surface of the mat is also slip-resistant, which helps to prevent injuries and provides a stable foundation for yoga and other exercises.\n\nAnother great feature of this product is its durability. The mat is made from high-quality materials that are built to last. The surface is easy to clean and maintain, and the mat does not show signs of wear and tear even after extended use.\n\nThe mat is also lightweight(about 2Ibs) and easy to transport. It comes with a carrying strap that makes it easy to take to and from the gym or yoga studio.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the Amazon Basics 1/2-Inch Extra Thick Exercise Yoga Mat to anyone looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and supportive mat for exercise or yoga practice. It's thick, slip-resistant, durable, and easy to transport, making it a great option for those who want to work out or practice yoga at home or on the go.",

        "content": "I read some slightly negative reviews on here about this product, and it not having some features in the app. Some people were miffed that the advanced security/parental features were a subscription, but that didn't apply to me. Until the time of purchase, I had been using a $60 mesh system from TCL, but the main problem was that the TCL only had 10/100 ports, and we normally have 20-ish devices connected at any given time. Needless to say, the network was very slow.\n\nOnce I pulled the trigger on this system (after extensive research to make sure it had GbE ports) I had high hopes for our network. This system was around $185 as opposed to the eero 3pk that ran closer to$250 - $300. I was excited for the Wi-Fi 6 as well.\n\nAfter unboxing, the instructions were clear on exactly how to set it up, and the Deco app made it very streamlined. Once the first node was configured, all I had to do was plug in and name the other two in the app, and they grabbed their configs automatically from the first node. Wi-Fi, I immediately noticed, was much more snappy, and I don't have a Wi-Fi 6 antenna in my phone. Each node has three total GbE ports on it, and they are self determining, so it doesn't matter which one you plug your internet service into. I was very happy about this, as it gave me the ability to have a dedicated port for each of my two 8-port GbE switches in my network cabinet.\n\nNOTE:\nDeco devices do NOT integrate with OneMesh devices, so don't get those two features mixed up. If you have OneMesh-compatible extenders already, then you can get the same mesh-like unified network feeling with a OneMesh-compatible router.\n\nThe system supports Ethernet Backhaul, so if your house is already wired up with Cat5e or better, you can plug these directly into your wired network to free up the Wi-Fi signal a bit. I don't have the luxury of a wired-networked house, so the Wi-Fi mesh works just fine for me.\n\nOne thing the eero system has that this one doesn't is a dedicated wireless band for the nodes to communicate with each other, so if that is a major deal breaker for you, then this is not the system you're looking for.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this system so far, and I haven't had problems with TP-Link products, so I hope to use it for years to come!",

It has parental controls, simple QoS, ability to block and allow access from certain devices, able to see reports on usage, etc., all in the easy to use app.\n\nThere is also a web page you can use to do a lot of the configuration if you prefer that, but the app is super easy to use. It is also pretty cool that the app will let you manage your network remotely if it is connected to the internet, as well as if you are on the wifi directly, you can manage it, even if the network is not on the internet.\n\nBeing able to spread these things out and either connect them to each other via wifi or a wired connection, and having a few wired ports on each of them really gives a lot of flexibility to your network.\n\nWant to add some wired connections to a desk, but not run an ethernet cable there? No problem, as long as the wifi signal can reach, just set one of these on that desk and you have three wired connections right there.\n\nNeed to extend wifi coverage beyond where it would normally be able to reach? Again, no problem, plug these in to ethernet ports in various places on the network and you have a wireless mesh network that lets you automatically switch between them as you are walking around, all without ever dropping signal.",

But unfortunately it only supported mesh when the Router was acting in Router mode, I needed just the Access Point functionality. So I had these two pieces of hardware that didn't provide the features I needed, I see that enabling the AP mode for Mesh is a feature requested by users on the TP-Link forum, but who knows if they will ever enable it.\nSo back to this product. The install couldn't have been easier, not a big fan of having to create an account to use the IOS app, but it is what it is. I am using the wired backhaul feature on one of the units and just regular wifi on the other. I no longer have drops when walking through my house while streaming an app. I am happy with the speeds which vary between 200-300. The app is decent, I can see all the devices and even control my Kasa smarthome switched ect. I was able to set this device up as AP mode with a couple taps on the IOS app and a reboot of the mesh devices.\nI now only have one wifi network name, devices that can use 5ghz connect to it as do the 2.4ghz. I have not have any issues as of yet.",

        "content": "25+ years ago, I bought my first home wireless system…it used a dial up modem in the hub and broadcast a few hundred square feet. Setting that up was a memorable process. I have lost count how many routers and wi-fi systems I have used, some easy some hard, so in our lake house I tried out the Deco-Mesh system. It was so easy to set up, so quick was the install that I almost felt cheated. If my grandmother were she still living, she could hook this up…instead of plug and play, it’s plug in and go to work.\nThe lake house is built like a bunker into the side of a hill complete with 8” thick concrete walls and slab. Our old wi-fi worked through the strategic placement of POE range extenders. The overall speed was not great but the service consistent. After installing the deco at the modem, I really didn’t know if I would need both additional mesh points or more, I really wasn’t sure if I would need all the POE range extenders. Wow, one unit covered 80% of the house…coverage degraded as you passed into the addition (through the 8” concrete wall). So I placed a mesh unit near the addition and that was is it. I am putting the last mesh point at the dock and I have coverage everywhere- no hocus pocus, no tech knowledge required.\n\nI liked the system so much that I am getting the XE75 model for our house ditching the much more expensive and much more problematic AmplifiHD mesh system.\nthe app for the deco products is also easy and informative. Long have I worried about people joining the network without my knowledge - deco provides an alert to my iPhone anytime a “new” device joins. It is those kinds of features that make the Deco system valuable.\nWi-fi 6 is worth the upgrade, too many people are paying for expensive GB internet when the max throughput of their network hardware is less than a GB. Wi-fi 6 is also smart recognizing the different demands of each attached device. After all, a roku and a light bulb have very different needs. With GB internet, and a network with more 100 devices, my speed tests are consistently above 800 mbs/800 mbs over a wi-fi connection- that is just amazing to me.\nSo if you are looking to upgrade and not break the bank or throw a ton of money into a system that will be outdated in a few years, I encourage you to give this deck unit a try.",

        "content": "My home is approximately 3000 sq ft with structured wiring for a gigabit ethernet switches and a gigabit connection to the ISP. Prior to buying the Deco I had a nighthawk router. I could get wifi signal to all of the house, but with some difficulty and wifi connection and speed was spotty in some parts of the house. I could've covered the entire house with just two Deco x55 units, but went with three and set them in different corners to make sure I had good wifi in the garage and around the outside of the house as well.\n\nThe Deco units are very easy to setup. The app for connecting to them is well designed, easy to use and I can monitor and administer my home network when I'm out of the house. The app has some advanced features that are hidden behind paywalls. All of the features you would commonly need are free and the advanced features are add-ons that you wouldn't normally expect from a wifi router. The wifi coverage is excellent and supports seamless roaming. No more lost connection of slow speed due to weak signals!\n\nFor my home I'm using ethernet connections for the wifi backhaul. However, when I tested the units I wasn't able to stress the system enough to tell the difference between using ethernet or wifi bandwidth for the backhaul.\n\nThe only negative so far is that I tried to use the main deco unit as traditional router with one port for the WLAN and the other two ports for LAN connections with this deco unit as the root of my network topology. Unfortunately, this set the LAN connection to 100Mb. The app doesn't show the LAN port settings and there aren't any lights, I just noticed that the speed test for all of the hardwired devices were being limited to 100Mb. Changing the network to use a switch as the root of the topology and having a single LAN connection from the deco to the switch fixed the issue.",

When I first set it up, the wireless was working, but wired connections were not. I rebooted the router and my wired devices, and that fixed the issue right away. The phone app is great for keeping track of all connected devices. I like that it lets you rename your device to something that makes sense to you, rather than just whatever the device defaults to.\n\nI've got the router connected to my modem in the northeast corner of the basement. I added a unit to the 2nd floor southwest corner. I am not using the 3rd unit. My connection speeds have improved dramatically over the house. One tip which helped was to set the main wi-fi settings to 5G only. The only issue with that was one device was only 2.4 capable, but I hardwired that, so problem solved.\n\nI am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend.",

The bad thing is when you are used to setting up a router by logging into the router it lacks the options of some other routers that I have used before, and the IP address and subnet mask are different from most other brands of routers. I only had one slight hiccup when I setup my wireless printer it took a little while to connect with the static address that I gave it but after setting it up it connected and is rock solid better than when I had a router and Wi-Fi extender. One of my satellites is in my shop about sixty feet from my main house but the master is in the middle of the house, and I can watch streaming video, listen to music on a dot, control my thermostat, lights and a fan and I can do it consistently without any problems.\nOne other thing that I do not like about it is that it only has three ports which when you connect the modem to one that only leaves two ports for ethernet connections. So, if you are looking for an inexpensive mesh router, I do not think you will go wrong with this TP-Link router.\nI have not contacted Tech Support so I cannot say if they are any good.",

I put 1 in the front of my house & 1 in back linked together with a CAT 6 cable then I have 1 in my bedroom using over the air linkup, basically forming a triangle.

Installation with the wires backhauls was a little confusing and unusual (you need to set it all up with no wires all in the same room first before you try to do wired backhauls which is weird to me). The app isn’t as pretty or intuitive as other offerings but it works and has been reliable which is the most important factor to me. I’m sure there are many tech people out there to give detailed nerd reviews but as a person that only cares about it working trouble free, it’s fitting this bill just perfectly\n\nProtip: They make you create an account (which requires internet) before you even set up your internet. So make sure you download the app, and make an account before you take your internet down to install. I have zero cellphone service so I had to drive down the road just to set up my account before it would let me setup my device. This is silly design in installation by Deco but probably doesn’t impact many people",

While running from the bear you need to quickly apply some peanut butter to a piece of paper and throw it to the side. You must keep running no matter how much you are compelled to write on the paper. As everyone already knows grizzly bears can't resist Amazon branded peanut butter (they are smart like you and enjoy reading my reviews too) and if you are fast enough and don't run out of peanut butter or paper your chance of survival increases.\n\nIf you are able to get far enough away attempt a quick glance over your shoulder. If you notice the bear sitting down and doing origami you are probably in the clear. Yell, \"Thank you for not killing me you magnificent grizzly bear you may have the rest of my cool paper and Amazon peanut butter!\" I know it will be hard to part with either of them but drop them, wave happily and RUN. Congratulations on not becoming drizzly bear food. There will be more cool paper in your future just click BUY NOW.",

        "content": "I was looking for storage units to create a pantry but everything I found was not the right size or if it was, the shelves were not adjustable. I found this unit and I loved the amount of weight each shelf held but I wanted the shelves to be closer together and I needed 8-10 shelves total. I searched all over the web to see if I can get extra shelves for this unit but didn't find any, so I decided to get 2 units and use whatever shelves I needed for one unit. I figured that most likely I would've paid more than $50 for 3-5 extra shelves, so for $100 I ended up making one awesome pantry. I used just 8 shelves and stored away 2 shelves and remaining poles. (NOTE: each leg is made out of 2 poles that gets screwed on top of each other so you can actually create 2 shorter units out of one unit)\nThe unit is pretty sturdy but it's a pain in the but to put together by one person. The shelves are held up in place by some plastic pieces that you have to connect and snap together in each corner and then lower the shelf from above on these pieces. The plastic pieces are marked with an arrow and the word TOP. Each pole has markings/indentations 1 inch apart all the way down. You hold 2 plastic piece together and place them around a pole, arrows pointing up, holding them together ABOVE the line on the pole where you want the shelf to end up. Holding the 2 pieces together and by sliding them down they end up in the indention on the pole at the level you want them to be. When they end up on the indention you'll hear a click and that's how you'll know they are locked together in the right place. Count to see on which indention you are on that pole and place the other pieces at the same level on the other 3 poles. Now, 2 things you have to know about these plastic pieces:\n1. They would not close together fully, meaning you might see a bit of a space between them.\n2. They stay put but when you lower the shelf you will have to hold each one in place and guide each corner of shelf's hole over them because if you don't do that and you hit one of pieces with the shelf they would snap open and you'll have to remove the shelf and connect the piece that disconnected from the pole. It would've been better if the plastic pieces were open only in one side and closing fully when snapped together. What I ended up doing was placing a piece of tape on one side of the plastic pieces (making one side like a door hinge) which made it easier for me to put the shelves over them. If I was hitting one corner by mistake the pieces would not snap off and fall down completely but stay on the pole giving me a chance to close them pretty quickly without having to remove the shelf anymore. At first I put tape all the way around the pieces but the tape was adding thickness to the pieces and they wouldn't fit in the shelves' holes. So, I tried tape only on one side and that worked. After all shelf's corners are places over the pieces, you will have to push down on the shelf, at the same time on all 4 corners to lock the shelf in place evenly.\nSo, with all that said, the units are pretty nice. The plastic pieces need some design improvement. If they were designed better this unit would've been a breeze to put together.\nOne thing I have to mention. I had room for a 46\" or 48\" W unit but that size unit was too deep for my space (I needed 12\"-14\"D unit and the 48\"W they sell on Amazon is 18\"-20\"D). So I ended up buy this 36\" W unit even though I was not using 10-12 inches of my space where I was planning to place the pantry. I made plans how to arrange baskets on each shelf based on the listed measurements. A lot of planning went into this since I had to consider how many baskets I needed and how much that would cost, finding the right size baskets etc, etc. Only after I ensemble the entire unit I found out that the 3 baskets I initially wanted to place side by side on each shelf would not fit and I was baffled not knowing why that would be.... Well, the unit is 36\" W, meaning the shelves are 36\" W but because the ploles are designed to be part of the shelves they take up about 3\" of the shelf. From one pole to the other you have 33\" width and because of that I couldn't use the baskets I needed to use and had to rethink the entire pantry, cost, sizes of items etc. Because of this unforeseen issue I lost a bit of space in the spot where I placed the unit (keep in mind that I could've used a much wider shelving unit to begin with) and I'm bumped about not using the space to the max as initially intended. I wish I knew about these details about the measurements before I made my decision to purchase this unit. The measurements were a very important part of my decision to purchase these units and they were not an easy item to ensemble and dissemble to send back to Amazon. Although my pantry turn up nice, I had a lot of headaches rearrange everything just because of the unknown measurements.\nAfter founding out that the shelves were not as wide as I expected them to be, I couldn't find baskets to fit so I ended up using Flat Rate shipping boxes from USPS (which are free, you can order them online or pick them up at a local USPS location) that I had to cut to size and covered in shelf/drawer lining. Not fun at all :(\nI would recommend this unit for it's sturdiness and price but buyer beware: you will have to spend some time putting it together if you don't have a 2nd person to help you. And, I hope you read my review if you're planning to use the the unit in a specific way where the exact measurements are a must to know before hand.\nI finished my pantry by covering the back and sides with a stiff plastic shower curtain, and with a fabric shower curtain for the front part.\nAnother thing I need to mention is that if you need to slide something on the shelf back and forth (like I wanted, a box to be pulled out and put back) the shelf's front is a bit higher and the item on the shelf will sit a bit lower and the edge will have a bit of a \"lip\" so you'll have to lift the item up a little at the edge to get the item over the \"lip\". I didn't like that, so in order to make the shelf smooth front to back, I came up with the idea to put cardboard on the shelf but a bit smaller than the shelf so the thickness of the cardboard when sitting on the shelf away from \"lip\" will come up at the same height with the lip, thus making the shelf same level from front to back. I needed 8 cardboard pieces long enough and very inexpensive. I bought 2 moving boxes 18\"x18\"x16\" from Menards ( about $5 with tax for both) and cut them lengthwise in 8 pieces. They were the perfect fit. To make sure the cardboard didn't move when pulling my boxes out, I taped the cardboard in each corner from underneath. Problem solved and it came out nice. I hope all this info might help someone who wants to use this unit for a pantry.\nPictures:\n1. How the unit looks with the cardboard on each shelf\n2. Work in progress, how the flat rate boxes look after I cut them to the size I needed to be\n3. How the unit looks from the back with the plastic shower curtain covering the back and sides\n4. How everything looks and how the unit looks like with 8 shelves on it\n5. I ended up finding some baskets that were perfect fit and blended well with the flat rate boxes. I didn't like the baskets' colors much but I had no choice, I made them work :)\n6. How the flat rate boxes looked like after covering them in shelf/drawer lining I got at Dollar Tree store and label them too :) Also, on the shelf with the 2 green baskets, in the back of the shelf I used a lazy susan I had before to be able to easily access my tomato paste cans.\n7. Final product. Front covered with fabric shower curtain that's easy to pull up to one side (see picture #4 to see how it seats on left upper corner). On top of the unit I places 3 foldable rectangular boxes (from Menards $6 ea) that I'll use for very light items (toilet paper, paper towels, napkins etc). To make sure all weight is distributed ok and unit stays in place first I made sure feet were leveled properly (the unit had screws at the bottom of each foot so you screw and unscrew each feet to level it properly to an uneven floor). Second, I secured the unit with velcro and plastic cable ties to the railing thats on the back of the unit (the unit comes with ties to secure it to walls but I used my own ties)\nThird, I placed my heavy items on the lower shelves (cans, sugar, flour, oil etc). And lastly, I placed my light items (mixed in with some light weight ones) on the upper shelves and the top one.\n8. I needed more light so I found this light that has a magnet on the bottom and a hook to hang anywhere. I can move it on any shelf, (standing up, sideways, etc) and have my hands free when I pull out a box/basket etc. It's awesome. I know, too much info, sorry :)",

        "content": "I bought this shelf to fit inside the cabinet opening left by the demise of our short-lived dishwasher so I could store cleaning supplies in the space (rather than just have them on the floor in baskets).\n\nIt was very easy to assemble. You need to make sure the tiny ridge inside each black support piece lines up with the appropriate groove in the leg you are clipping it to, but once you do that you're good.\n\nIt was advertised as \"heavy duty\". I would not personally call it that, based on the gauge of the wire used for the shelving. I'd say more medium-to-heavy duty, as you cannot load these shelves very heavily or they WILL bend and sag.\n\nThis makes storing some of the jumbo bottles of Pine-Sol and Murphy's Oil Soap awkward, but I placed them at the outer edges where part of the weight is supported by the rim around the shelf. I think the weigh per shelf is about 35 lbs. max, if I remember correctly, so most of the big bottles ended up sitting on the floor in front of this unit--but that's fine.\n\nThis unit fit the opening very well (I went by the given measurements compared to dimensions of my cabinet opening) and really did what I wanted it to do. If it had been slightly sturdier, even better--but I am not unhappy with what I got.",

After the usual scan of different shelving units, I purchased this one to organize the garage. The weight capacity per shelf suits my needs and the buyer comments were above average. There is an excellent video to show how easy it is to assemble. I highly recommend watching the video. I was able to assemble by myself in no time. The two most important tips were to unpack and sort the parts. The second tip is to make sure you understand that there is a top and bottom on the clips. Count the grooves on each pole so your shelf is level, the clips will \"click\" into the groove you choose. If the clip doesn't slide you are good. The shelf will slip over the clip and it will hold in place. It arrived with minor dings in the cardboard packaging but no damage to the contents and all parts received. After being satisfied with everything, I purchased another 4-shelf unit (no casters) and two 4-shelf units with casters.",

        "content": "I'm very pleased with this rack and was able to put it together by myself, although a helping hand in the beginning would have been helpful. There are 8 poles, 2 of which screw into each other to make one, tall pole (therefore a total of 4 poles.) When the poles are initially placed in the holes of the shelf placed on the bottom, it's awkward to stand up the entire rack without a pole falling out. But on my second attempt I did it!\nAs others have advised, watch how you place each shelf on the poles as there is a correct way...with the lip around the sides facing down. This way the rack slides down over the slightly tapered clips (which clip onto the poles wherever you decide you want the height to be) and this gives each shelf stability. Just don't place clip near where the 2 poles are joined together (as advised). I also cut up part of the cardboard box to match the shape of the shelf to use as a \"liner\" so that small items don't fall through the slats.\nIt's a very nice shelving unit.",

        "content": "This fits perfectly in my laundry room. I bought two to go on both sides of machine. I needed it for laundry detergents and such. I do have top shelves for that, but I am short and instead of always using a foot stool or reaching for my products they would sit on machines. I hated that because I like order and neatness and I did not with time have machines get rusty.\n\nAnyway, the assembly it took a good 10 to 15 minutes because the directions are not made simple enough to understand. So, I had to try to figure it out as I went along. It is quite easy once you get it together, but those directions threw my mind for a loop.\n\nNow as I write this, I noticed the photo and see that the shelves are supposed to fit over the black clips. lol So, for those who are thinking of purchasing this. If you should, make sure not to let the black clips confuse you if they don't click together all the way. Also, make sure the shelves are pushed down on the clips and make sure the shelves are flat at the top of shelving as shown in photo because if not it will be unstable. I found that out when I wondered why I put together one and the last one was wobbly. The shelving was upside down. lol\nOther than that, I now have an organized laundry room. It's like breathing fresh air. :-)",

I'd have preferred 18x36\" for the same price (paid $40@ for 18x36\" back in 2018 but those days are gone). I considered these mid-strength as the shelf wires run side-to-side. High-strength the wires run front-back, weigh more, and cost more (you can compare on Amazon or elsewhere).\n\nI'm planning to replace the adjustable feet with casters, which I've done with the 18x36\" shelves. Went to HD with one foot and used their nut-and-bolt gauges. In this case, the support is 3/8\"-16 (coarse thread) x 1\" long (see photos). No guarantee every one is the same, so worth checking. Threaded-stem casters should cost about $15-$20 for a set of 4 on Amazon.",

        "content": "I may have an addiction to these 'Amazon Basics' shelving units, I just bought my 6th one! I started with the butcher's block/microwave cart unit and was thrilled with it. Then I discovered the tall 5-shelf unit and bought one. I liked that so much I bought 2 more of the tall ones. Then I bought this short 3-shelf unit on Prime Day and got so excited about it that I went back and ordered a second before the sale was over.\n\nSo let's get the assembly \"controversy\" out of the way. I won't attempt detailed directions here, but I hope you'll trust me when I say these really are incredibly easy to assemble. And they're perfectly stable and sturdy once assembled. Any review that says these are crazy difficult, or \"won't stay together\" or that they \"wobble\" etc have all assembled them incorrectly. Please consider that I have bought SIX of these now, I'm a pro. I can assemble these small ones in about 8-10 minutes leisurely, and the tall 5-shelf ones in about 15 minutes each - and that includes time for me to ponder ideal shelf placement! That's at a relaxed pace and there is zero frustration. Now, I will admit that I was initially perplexed on my very first unit for a few minutes as I fumbled around with the black connectors trying to make sense of them. I too thought \"this thing is junk\" until I realized I was not realizing how they work. Once I understood the simplicity of it, the rest all flew together with ease and are actually fun to assemble. I could quite literally assemble these with my eyes closed at this point.\n\nWatch the videos which should help. But generally: the connectors come in 2 halves that fit together around the pole. Be sure to look for the arrow pointing up so you have them upright. Also look INSIDE for the little ridge lines, this is super helpful. Those lines line up with the single lines on the chrome pole. I actually place them just above the chrome pole line and slide them down until I hear/feel them click into place. The two halves fit together but with a slight GAP. Meaning that they do not close together entirely. They stay in place but will look slightly separated - this is normal! Do not try to force them to fit together tightly, they aren't intended to. When you push the shelf (lightly, there's no need to force it) down over the black connectors, it wedges them closed a bit more. This is by design so that the shelves aren't loose and popping up; they stay in place nicely.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the black coin-like caps in the box are packing scrap and can be tossed out or repurposed but are not parts for the unit. Lastly, the edging on the shelf goes DOWN. They are NOT lips to hold things on the shelf. You might be able to make it work that way, but it's not meant to be that way. Just know that if you're having a hard time with any part of putting these together, you're doing it wrong. I can assure you, I live alone and have no one around to give me a hand, so I would never buy SIX of these units unless they were super easy to assemble, because I am not a very patient person.\n\nThese are stable, strong, hold a ton of weight and are extremely versatile, which is why I love them so much. They go with just about any decor style. I have two of the tall units as pantry shelving and a third tall unit in my art studio. I came up with a creative way to use these small 3-shelf ones by putting a 6 foot x 18\" piece of plywood over two of them (one at each end with a space in the center) which serves as a sideboard/counter and/or deskpace area in my rustic kitchen where I can roll out bread dough or sit down to pull up recipes on my laptop, etc with baking supplies on the shelves underneath. The leveling feet are handy too. My ONLY complaint is that the prices on these fluctuates dramatically, so I tend to wait and snag one when I see them on sale. I'm considering getting one for the bathroom (towels etc) and maybe even one for off-season clothes storage. They look so classy and nice and the storage and organization they offer is fantastic. These units are some of the best things I've ever purchased on Amazon actually.",

It came with not only the 4 inch wheels but also adjustable feet if you didn't want to use wheels. The steal was very strong. The posts screw into one another instead of just pushing them in like most units. The finish was excellent. The design and engineering is outstanding. Assembly was a breeze. Took about 20 minutes with no tools. I would recommend buying the gorilla grip shelf liners which fit this perfectly. All in all I would highly recommend this product. It's a bargain at this price. I plan to buy more units.",

        "content": "Purchased one of these originally and found it to be very sturdy and that was what I had hoped for. I bought a so called plastic 5 tier TOUGH shelf from Walmart and it was rated for 50 lbs per shelf. After a few months, with only about 20 lbs on the shelf, there was severe sag and I was really disappointed with that product. i wanted to replace it with a heavy wire metal unit so I came across this one at only about 10 dollars more. It took about 30 minutes to assemble it the first time and I had to learn that the plastic clips that positioned each shelf had a special 'click\" to it be be sure it was secure. I mismatched the position of the clips a couple times and had to redo that corner but one I got the hand of it, it went smoothly. I really like how sturdy it is and it can hold at least the weight that it lists. Looks good too in chrome. It also was large enough since I wanted shelves that were closer to 30 inches wide. So this unit fit the criteria as I had hoped and am very pleased with it. I searched again for something like it a month later to fill another area with shelving in the garage. There was nothing else wide enough in the same design, sturdiness, and width in comparison to this one. SO, I bought another one and I am very happy with these units. If I were to buy another, the only change would be if they had a lower price but this was the only option worth considering for me.",

I will edit this review in the event that this ever does break but I highly doubt that will happen so if youre seeing this review its good and has been set up with no problems to this day since the date listed above\n\nI saw some about how the things you put together are plastic and they should be some different material but my dad has other shelf racks that also have the plastic peices and thats because the \"thin plastic\" goes sideways so its the thickness of the side vertically holding the shelves not the thin part the way they designed it can actually hold a lot of weight and the shelves that go on top lock on airtight in a way that the plastic parts wont be moving anyway so its pretty secure Im pretty sure almost all if not all of these shelf racks have plastic bands Ive not seen one with a differnt material for them and my dad is perfectly fine putting loads of weight on these\n\nYou can use the indented rings around the legs to count how high youre putting each plastic bit up and make sure youre getting them all at the same height and around every 8th dent is a second indented ring to help you count without losing track I havent seen any complaints about not knowing how to do this but if you didnt know now you know\n\nTheres a lot of people saying the design \"has no way of holding that much weight\" I have a 20 long paladarium on the top of mine and have had it set up for a few months now and it has a 10 and a 6 gallon on one row then a 10 on the lowest row so yes it can hold lots of weight fishtanks are heavy cuz of all the substrate and paladariums are heavier it has loads of substrate and water and I had to use lots of petrified rock for it too so I can confidently tell you itll hold whatever you wanted to put on it too",

The company is named after Heinz Hankhammer's daughter, Brita. As a corporation, Brita is committed to community and environmental outreach through projects like FilterForGood.com, a campaign dedicated to the reduction of bottled water waste.\n\nWhat's in the Box\n3-pack Brita Replacement Filters\n\n\nSee more",

With the recent price increase for just one long last filter, I thought we could try the standard this time. I received 4 standard filters for less than the price of one long last. At first the filter had the the water tasting like it had a little chlorine but that soon resolved after a couple more refills. We are at week 4 after about 2 gallons a day (we go through alot of water) the filter is still properly working, draining and the water still tastes great. If the other 3 filters work out like the first, we will probably switch to standard filters!",

    "description": "Product Description\n\nResistance Bands - 5 Loop Fitness Bands Set - Loop Exercise Resistance Bands - Exercise Bands For Legs And Arms - Carry Bag\n\n\nAre you ready for the most versatile, results producing workout bands on the market?\n\nThese bands are ideal for\n- Sports\n- Fitness\n- Injury rehabilitation\n- body shaping\n- weight loss\n- physical therapy\n\n\nHow do our bands differ?\n\nFirst, our bands are made of high quality latex (not rubber bands which are much cheaper and tend to break easily). They are stronger and able to stretch further. You will feel the same resistance after a dozen reps.\n\nThese bands are made of latex, not materials such as Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) - TPE materials cost 40% less, are not gentle to skin and much less durable.\n\nSecond, our bands are comfortable, soft and easy on the skin. The only way to achieve that is to let the latex rest for a long time in tightly controlled circumstances such as temperature and humidity before making the bands.\n\nBoth of these involve a higher investment for us but we think it's worth it to create a better product.\n\n\nWhat makes our resistance bands special?\n\nThese bands are rigorously tested to be snap, stretch and sweat resistant.\n\nYou get 5 resistance bands set and you can combine multiple bands to find your ideal resistance.\n\nThese bands are so lightweight that they make a great travel fitness kit!\n\nThis is also a great Christmas, Mother's and Father's day gift idea for men, women, dad or mom.\n\n\n",

        "content": "There are few items on Amazon for under $10 that are as fantastic as this mini waffle maker. My Wife and I absolutely love it, as does our Little Girl. And what's not to love about it? It makes perfect Eggo-sized waffles, in record time. I do have a few quick suggestions for anyone that's interested in getting it, as well as one terrific hack for using this waffle maker that will be a real game-changer for breakfast and desserts. First off, how to use it....\n\nWe use Krusteaz Belgian waffle mix, although just about any waffle or pancake mix will do. We recently got a KPKitchen batter dispenser for pancakes and waffles, which makes it easier to get just the right amount of batter into the waffle iron each and every time.\n\nWHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BATTER DISPENSER?\n\nQuick pro tip I can offer you. Don't have a fancy measured batter dispenser? Next time you finish off a bottle of ketchup, mustard, squeeze jelly, etc, don't throw away the container. Wash it well. Then when you have your pancake or waffle batter mixed, just remove the top to the squeeze bottle, and pour the batter in. Pop the top back on. And now you've got an easy-squeeze bottle that lets you perfectly pour batter info waffle makers or on a frying pan. Best of all, you don't have to use all of the batter at once. When you're done making waffles, just close the cap, and stick the bottle in the fridge. It will usually stay good for 2-4 days, just don't leave it at room temp for more than two hours at a time.\n\nBACK TO MAKING THE WAFFLES....\n\nThe easiest way to \"grease\" the waffle maker is to simply do a quick spray of Pam on each hot plate before you start making them. If you want waffles that are soft on the outside, spray between each waffle made. If you like a golden brown, slightly crispy/crunchy texture to your waffles, you only need to use the cooking spray once. Stick to using silicone and similar spatulas (avoid using metal utensils) to remove the waffle when it's finished. What's terrific about the size of this waffle maker is that if you have a leftover waffle or two after eating, you can simply stick them in the fridge or freezer for later, and pop them into your toaster (something you can't do with regular-sized waffle makers). Okay, now to the really cool part....\n\nYou can make the most amazing waffles with this thing using just canned cinnamon rolls. Without everyone having to wait forever for cinnamon rolls to be baked in the oven. Get a can of the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing. Now you can use the icing as-is, but you can make it \"pourable\" by adding a few ingredients. Just whisk/stir the included cream cheese icing with a cup of powdered sugar, three tablespoons of milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Once it's smooth, set it aside. When the waffle maker is hot and ready, stick one cinnamon roll directly in the center of it, and close the top firmly. What's going to happen is that it will slowly rise, the top will slowly move up as well. Grab the \"handle\" for the top and firmly press it down a second time. What this does is not only flatten the roll to completely fit the circle of the waffle iron, but ensures that it stays flat and baked through. You can eyeball and it and tell when it's made to your liking, I've found that it takes just slightly longer to make a cinnamon roll waffle than a regular waffle made with batter. Before each waffle is served, drizzle your cream cheese glaze over it. Not only do you have an amazing waffle with a taste like none other, but you don't need any type of pancake or waffle batter on hand. I experimented and also made Pillsbury orange rolls with orange icing, they were fantastic. Just remember, the key to making perfectly round cinnamon roll waffles is to close the lid not once, but a second time as the roll starts to rise in your waffle maker.\n\nThere are plenty of things you can buy for ten bucks. But instead of spending ten bucks on fast food, or two iced coffees, invest it something that you'll actually use often. And when you order one of these, you'll definitely use it often. Breakfast waffles. Piping hot cinnamon roll waffles topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. Fried chicken and waffle sandwiches. Your only limit is your imagination. You can do what I did, read plenty of reviews, and then decide to order it. Or you could just see for yourself how great it works, it's only $10. Go ahead and add it to your shopping cart, you'll be glad you did.",

This maker is small, compact and takes about 4 minutes to produce a nice, warm, golden waffle. It's easy to clean and takes up little space to store. I just love this thing!

        "content": "I am very happy with this mini waffle maker! I was expecting the recipe book to be maybe 5 recipes, but it is a full book with a lot of variety. I made the honey waffles on page 30 because I didn't have any butter and it was a dairy free recipe. I subbed the safflour oil (I didn't have that either) for olive oil and added lemon extract and cinnamon and also topped w/ peanut butter. I was surprised at how light and fluffy they were. The maker is super easy to use and clean. My only complaint is that the indicator light isn't timed like my old maker, so you have to guess at the perfect cooking time. These took about 2.5 minutes to cook. If you want perfectly round waffles like the box shows and less \"edgy,\" use a 1/4 cup of batter carefully measured and not 3 TBS as the recipe calls for, even though it is close to the same (I I didn't figure that out until my last waffle in the batter). I highly recommend this waffle maker and I can't wait to try more recipes and invent my own. Oh, and the measuring spoons are super cute too!",

While you can't change the temperature, this little gadget is the easiest waffle iron we've used.

        "content": "This is a countertop dishwasher with a built in water tank. It appears to be one of very few of this type of dishwasher that contains its own water tank. This is the main reason why this unit costs more than other countertop dishwashers available on Amazon. The primary advantage of having a unit like this with a built-in tank is that you can safely wash a load of dishes unattended.\n\nMost dishwashers do not have a built-in tank and receive water through one of two methods: a connection to a water source through a hose that is cleanly integrated into your kitchen, or through a hose connected to a kitchen faucet that must be left on during the wash cycle and removed when finished, which is usually how countertop dishwashers are fed water. With this unit, that source is not needed, and you can instead fill the tank on the dishwasher and run it unattended. This dishwasher does also come with a fitting to hook it up to a faucet if you wish to use it that way.\n\nThe drain hose comes with a suction cup that lets you exhaust waste water into a nearby sink, or into a bucket that can then be emptied. This flexibility is the biggest reason why I like this dishwasher.\n\nAnother positive about this unit is how economical it is: it will wash a load using only 5 liters of water and is extremely energy-efficient. It also seems to do a great job getting my stuff clean and spotless without the use of a rinse aid, it's got a neat little window where you can watch the little thing get to work. This unit comes with the aforementioned intake and exhaust hoses, a pitcher to be used to fill the unit with water, and a fruit-washing basket that can be used with the unit to wash fruit on a special cycle just for that purpose. The unit clasps shut with a magnetic lock that holds the door shut after 4 minutes into a cycle to prevent accidental opening resulting in water pouring out of the unit.\n\nThis unit also features a glass wash cycle for baby bottles. I have not used this feature and cannot speak for it's value.\n\nAs far as negatives go, I have a few but they're minor. This unit is not compatible with rinse aids; the manual explicitly says not to use them. This isn't my first dishwasher so I had a couple of bottles that I had to give away because I couldn't use them. The unit also recommends against using detergent pods. You can still use them, but you must use full wash cycles or they do not dissolve properly. My biggest complaint would have to be about the overall capacity, which is smaller than other countertop dishwashers. While those units are designed to support dishes and placement for up to six dining sets, this unit is really designed to accommodate two, along with a serving bowl. Because of it's small space, sometimes loading the dishwasher is a bit like playing Tetris. I have managed to get four settings into this unit with plates, cups, flatware and a small serving bowl, and that's about as much as it will hold. If you overload the dishwasher, or load it incorrectly with too many large objects, it will fail to wash them correctly. You must also be careful about how large your objects are; it will not fit plates larger than 10\", and it can be a little difficult finding dinner plates that small; you would want to make sure your plates aren't too big before dropping money for something like this, otherwise you're buying new servingware also. Finally, the fruit washer is more of a novelty feature than an actually useful one. I put eight apples into it, loaded it with water, and it ran for 20 minutes. I could've probably done this by hand in less than five.\n\nThis isn't the right fit for everyone, but it's great for couples with no or one children, people who live in tiny houses, RVs or conversion vans, or single people without a dishwasher who don't like to do dishes. For anyone who uses this with the idea of draining wastewater into a bucket, it's recommended that you drain and clean the bucket between every load washed; waste particulate in the waste water will attract bugs if left unattended.",

        "content": "04/20/22 Update\nEverything still working as it's supposed to but my dish rack is now rusting and falling apart. I never did anything to it, never bent it, never cut into the plastic wrap around it..nothing...but it's rusting and falling apart. I need a new one and I hope I can get one otherwise I have a large paperweight on my hands.\n*******************************\n\n06/30/2021 UPDATE\nIt's been almost 4 months since I've owned this and I have never been happier. I use this dishwasher at least twice a day every single day. I use powder detergent from the big box store with a blue logo and I use their store brand. It's the best stuff ever and very inexpensive to buy. I have changed one thing, I no longer use the magnet to keep the door ajar to dry the interior and dishes. The reason being is that I didn't think about keeping the seal moist and not letting it dry out. It's imperative the seal stays supple so it work properly. Also I buy a dishwasher cleaner from Amazon so it will help eliminate hard water deposits in the machine. I buy a little bag, about $7, and it lasts me several uses since I use such a small amount whereas 1 bag is normal for a normal size dishwasher. Don't listen to the naysayers and negative reviews. Yes it's small...it's a small dishwasher..don't expect to fill it to the brim and get everything sparkling clean. You have to arrange everything to make sure the jet spray hits everything. I have found out one thing, I was pouring water in the machine yesterday, got the beeps and realized that I didn't turn the machine on first. So..it's good to know it will let me know it's full of water without it being turned on...good to know. Again, best purchase I've made and I highly recommend it.\n\nNext to my portable washing machine I bought a few months ago, this is my new love. I cannot say enough good things about it. I call her Rosey after the Jetson’s robot. She’s sleek, sexy and cleans. She didn’t come cheap though that’s for sure.\n********************************\nWhen I unpacked Rosey, I noticed some rusty looking stuff in the bag on the side of the machine towards the bottom back. When I opened the plastic wrap there was a hint of rust smell. This worries me just a bit. I’m sure most of everything in Rosey is plastic so I’m curious as to what is metal and rusts especially in a dishwasher. She did have some moisture and water droplets in it and I knew they tested it beforehand, I just thought they might have let it dry first before tightly packing it up to ship. I wonder how long it stayed wrapped with water in it before I got it. As I said this worries me and I hope I won’t have problems in the future. I did buy the extra warranty just in case.\n\nRosey is quick, thorough and a lifesaver. I have a bad back and our kitchen sink is low, I’m 5’9” and I found myself leaning on my arms while washing dishes; I’d also take breaks before I get done. Now I don’t have to be in pain while washing the dishes. It’s just my 86 yr old mother and myself so there isn’t a lot of dishes but enough to do 2 loads a day. I want also to comment that yes it’s a small machine but it will fit the lid to my 8qt Instant Pot or my Dutch oven with no problems. Some are complaining that the machine is \"too small\" \"so tiny\" \"...can't fit my dishes\" and I call them whiners. It's a small machine...you get what you pay for so don't expect to get HUGE loads of dishes done; it's not going to happen. What needs to happen is the person needs to learn how to play Tetris and Jengo and learn how to stack and lean dishes. Do more loads as well. You can't expect to get all the dishes done at once if it's completely full and the bottom sprayer arm can't spray the dishes above it.\n\nI have noticed that if the cart is too heavy with dishes the sprayer arm will catch on the bottom of the basket and not rotate. I have played around with the basket and I have figured out that either I can distribute the weight in towards the back of the basket OR there’s just enough room to place something, a small plastic or rubber thing but not sure what since I haven’t done it yet, under the front left wheel and that will lift the basket just enough to give clearance to the sprayer arm on the bottom. As I said, I haven’t tried it yet but I will one day. Meanwhile, the top sprayer arm is a hit and miss during rotation as well and I’m not sure why. I have included a picture of the top sprayer arm and with a twist of the middle the arm will come out of the washer and you have to make sure you line up everything just right to put it back. I took it out, inspected it, no blockage, rinsed it out and put it back but to no avail it still rotates intermittently or slowly. I have to assume is the water pressure that rotates it, just like the bottom arm, and that it just isn’t getting enough pressure maybe. It works and gets the job done. I haven't had any dirty dishes after washing them so I can't complain.\n\nI have read and reread thru all the reviews and learned quite a few things from other people’s experience with the machine. There were a few people who were confused thinking the whole middle piece comes out of the bottom metal filter and what I found out is that the plastic middle OF the bigger round middle piece comes out and makes it easier to clean inside the filter. I have attached a pic of what I’m talking about.\n\nAlso, the whole pouring water in the top hole in the machine thing is brilliant BUT it’s design is flawed as more water would splash up out on top than IN the machine and when filling the machine 3 and ½ pitchers full of water some is bound to end up all over the place. I saw a review that used a collapsible silicone basin with drain over the hole and that’s how she fills her machine but I got to wondering about a canning jar funnel since it’s shorter and wider so I found once on Amazon and ordered it. As I continued to read the reviews I found someone else who had just done that herself. Two great minds think alike! I’ve attached a pic of that as well.\n\nNow yes the machine sucks moisture out with the \"Air Fresh\" cycle selected and it mostly of dries everything but it’s not completely dry (at least 90%) and I tried to figure out a way to leave the door ajar so air can circulate but nothing would work UNTIL I thought of using a small magnet. I had a refrigerator magnet break on me a while back so I threw the plastic away but kept the magnet. It’s a little rectangle sized magnet and pretty much the same size as the door magnet on the machine. Once the machine is completely done I put the magnet on the machine and close the door…et voila!...the door stays ajar with a crack to circulate air and it keeps the door closed out of the way. The light automatically turns off so I didn’t have to worry about it staying on. JUST make sure you take off the magnet before you start washing. I turned on the machine but it wouldn't let me select a cycle and I thought the machine was broken but then remembered the magnet. I took the magnet off, closed the door and was able to set the cycle and start the machine. Nice feature that it won't let the machine start without the door being tightly closed. Brilliant! Again, a pic is attached as well.\n\nI bought two types of detergent, powder and gel, and I can’t really tell a difference between the two when it comes to how well it cleans the dishes. I have read that powder is best if you have hard water and stuck on food since it has enzymes. My water is so hard if I threw it at someone it would kill them; gotta love the water in the desert southwest of Arizona. I do worry about hard water deposits tho as I have to regularly use vinegar in my coffee pot and tea kettle to get rid of it. I’ve read that vinegar is bad for any dishwasher so I’m not sure what to do if problems arise.\n\nOh…I read someone’s review that said they had a problem with the cheap suction cup on the drainage hose so I bought some aquarium suction cups with plastic straps and stuck them on my drainage hose and they work great. Also, one more tip, I added a Command strap on the back side so I can coil up the drainage hose to get it out of the way as needed. Now DON’T do what I did and forget it was there and use the machine…what a mess….lol\n\nOverall this is a brilliant piece of kitchen machinery and I’m so so so happy I got it. I plan on babying Rosey and treating her right in hopes that she will last a few years. And before I forget, there is someone on YouTube who has figured out the error codes and he tells you what to do. I will say one thing that’s handy is pushing the Glass button and the Air Fresh button will starting the draining process and that’s really handy to know.",

        "content": "I love this dishwasher. I love that it has a tank because my kitchen is set up in a way that makes it difficult to get the dishwasher close enough to the sink to hook it up. I keep it on my kitchen table and let it drain into a stock pot that I keep on a chair. The tiny challenge is that I can't fill up the tank quickly because the water splashes all over if I try to pour it in too quickly. I assume it takes way less time than it would to cart it over to the sink and hook it up, though. The tank needs to be filled 3 times with a 1.8 liter pitcher. I originally wondered why it didn't come with a larger pitcher so you only had to fill it up once. But a big pitcher would be much heavier. It would be too heavy for some people, particularly anyone elderly.\n\nI can use my kitchen sink while it's running because it's not hooked up to it. And I can run it at the same time as the washing machine or shower. I like the window.\n\nThe dishwasher usually cleans very well. I had trouble once but determined it was because a large pot lid was blocking some of the other dishes. Dishes can come out a little dirty occasionally but it's usually fine. The normal setting leaves some spots on glass items sometimes but that's not a big deal to me. I haven't used the glass setting before and I may never use it because it's not something I need. So I don't know how well that works.\n\nThere isn't a basket but the silverware rack seems to hold small objects securely. I put the little pieces from my Instant Pot on top of the rack and put the little cup shaped \"anti-block shield\" over the littlest rubbery piece to hold it in place so it doesn't get lost.\n\nI'm not sure if the drying feature really works. I usually run the dishwasher before I leave the house and come back to it many hours later, and the dishes are usually pretty wet. (Update, the dishes are dry right away. They seem to collect condensation or something if the door isn't opened soon after the cycle.) I did just wash one large mixing bowl on its own and took it out right away and it was dry. So I don't know if it stays wet because of things like the inverted mug bottoms collecting water or if the dishes are perhaps initially dried but become wet again from condensation if they sit too long. I unload the dishes onto my drying rack and then put them away after they air dry so it's not a problem. A full load fits into a drying rack with few problems.\n\nThe dishwasher was packaged well and arrived in good condition. (I load trucks at FedEx and I know what packages go through so I can appreciate the quality of the packaging, haha.)\n\nThis last note isn't about this specific product really, but it's important to me. My mental health has improved so much over the last few months of having this dishwasher. I don't like doing dishes, and am perpetually physically exhausted from work. My kitchen has always been covered in overwhelming dirty dishes meaning I can't use the space at all and have always had no clean dishes to cook with. Now that I have a dishwasher I can keep on top of the dishes. I only do dishes for myself and find that I can keep up by running it once a day because it holds very little. (This is good because it means I don't wrestle with terribly dried on food because dishes are washed they day they get dirty.) I find I can handle washing a few pots and pans by hand (they won't fit in the washer) if I've got the dishwasher to do the little stuff. Between the dishwasher and my recent Instant Pot purchase, I'm able to eat better quality food and eat more regularly. I'm also enjoying cooking for the first time in a long time. All this has been amazing for my depression.\n\nUpdate: I bought the dishwasher in 2019. It's 2022 now. It's still going strong. Still leaves dishes slightly dirty sometimes but they're usually good. And it's usually my fault for trying to cram too much in. It's set up differently in the apartment I live in now as the pictures show. It used to sit on my kitchen table and drain into a stock pot on a kitchen chair. In my new apartment I set it up on a table of similar height with the stock pot on the ground. I turned it on the first time and went to work. My landlord started texting me that water was leaking into the apartment below me. When I got home I could tell that the first time water gushed out of the hose during the cycle, it sent the hose flying out of the bucket so it just drained onto the floor.\n\nThe manager and maintenance guy looked at it the next day and told me they don't allow dishwashers in their buildings, but since it doesn't hook up to the faucet, they'd give me a chance to keep it as long as it didn't happen again. I now tie the hose to the handle on the stock pot with a shoe lace, and have had no more problems.\n\nI'm so sad to see in other people's review that the warranty sucks. Cuz if your unit functions properly, it's great. (This thing seriously changed my life so I'm weirdly passionate about it.)",

        "content": "This is exactly what it looks like. I use mine almost every day, and it works great. There is a little rattling in it sometimes, but I put it on before bed in the kitchen and never notice it.\nI was really happy with this product. I will say that the plastic silverware holder did start to bend a little, but I put it in boiling water and it went back to its original shape.\nThe settings are super easy to use and navigate. I use pods when washing my dishes, and it works with the pods I use. I recommend using the extended wash for pods though.\nThe only complaint I have is that the filter is a little difficult to clean, but running hot water through it, and scrubbing it with hands works fine.\nBe sure to clean it every so often or it may start to smell, but that is the case with all dishwashers.\n\nI 100% recommend this dishwasher for apartments or office spaces that do not have dishwasher. The capacity is not huge, but that is not what it is meant to be. Plates, cups and silverware will fit inside, and it makes for a great purchase. I bought mine within the last year, and I was not sure about the price. I am happy to report some time later that this product is exactly what I wanted, and needed for my apartment. It sits right under my cabinet.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is filling this with water. I have my own little system worked out, but it was a pain to fill at first. This will be the case with any dishwasher not connected to a water source, so I can't complain that much, but at first it was a little annoying. Overall, I am very pleased with this product, and its longevity thus far.",

        "content": "First of all - I cannot recommend this enough. I run it about once a day with all my dishes from the day. Now bigger pots won't fit, but I probably would have hand washed them even with a full size dishwasher.\nPros:\nIt was really easy to get set up (if you can't lift heavier things easily alone, make sure you have help).\nIt is really easy to use. Just fill the dishwasher, set what type of cycle you want to run, fill with water, and start!\nDespite what you may see online in other spots - it absolutely uses less water than handwashing. The amount of water it takes is less than what it would take to fill my sink to soak my dishes. Which is one of the arguments I've seen around saying that people must just run their sink the whole time while handwashing to use more water.\n\nCONs:\nYou do need a funnel to pour the water in without making some sort of mess. (but this is a minor con)\nThe instructions are a bit confusing/backwards on which spot is the intake/outtake for the water. It says in the diagram that the intake is on the left, but it's not. It's on the right. Luckily it also describes how they look.\nThe piping included is a bit long if you're going to set up right next to your sink. I have mine wrapped all the way around my double sink, but I'm sure you could probably just cut it or get a smaller one.\n\nTo me the cons are very minor and the pros way outweigh it. Handwashing dishes was one of those chores that seemed very daunting even though I know it only takes about 15 minutes, it just would end up piling up and becoming more and more daunting. But now that chore is gone and I can focus on other things.",

        "content": "I purchased this dishwasher about 3 months ago, and have been using it 2-3 times per week since then. I live in a small apartment (about 700 square feet), without much room for large appliances. I was looking for a countertop dishwasher and tried one from another brand. It was about the same width and depth as a standard-size dishwasher, but only tall enough to hold one dish rack. Let's say the name of that manufacturer rhymes with “Tragic Jeff.” That thing leaked on my first attempte to use it, and based on my poor experience with that machine, I was super leery of trying another one. Most of the online reviews for other brands seemed to all have the same bipolar distribution of 1-star “disappointment” vs 5-star “elation” about the machines. This is always a red flag for me, since I can never be sure if reviews are unbiased or paid by the manufacturer. When I found this Farberware dishwasher I hesitated for a few months before purchasing, since there did not seem to be much information about it, and there was a lack of customer reviews.\nSince receiving it, I have not been disappointed. It is exactly what I need, and it has not given me any problems. After 3 months I don’t regret my decision to purchase, and would recommend it to people in my situation.\n\nWhat I like:\n-It is of “miniature” size. I typically use luncheon size plates, 9” in diameter, and they fit just fine, but I can see how larger dinner plates might not fit. Pans probably would not fit, either.\n-It has a window in the door and a light on the inside. Kind of a novelty, but it’s rather fun to watch the dishes get clean.\n-Rapid and Normal modes. The Normal mode is for typically dirty dishes, and the rapid is less than an hour.\n-It has a tank. This was a surprise to me when I got the thing. It comes with a pitcher that you can use to pour all of the water needed into the top of the machine at the start of the cycle, without needing to have the supply hose hogging the faucet at the kitchen sink.\n\nWhat I don’t like:\n- It is of “miniature” utility. There is one row for loading items, and trying to fit too many things (like stacking bowls on top of plates) will just result in the top items not getting clean.\n- It is of \"miniature\" ability. The dishes must be pretty clean when loading it- there is no disposal or “pots and pans” mode, like the big washers have.\n-It doesn’t dry very well. Yes, there is a fan to circulate the air at the end of the Normal cycle, but there is not a heating element get dishes completely dry. (Maybe this a good feature, since there is not the risk of getting plastic lids warped by the heat.)\n-It beeps. Lets say your load the washer and then head to bed. At the end of the two-hour Normal cycle it beeps to let you know the dishes are clean. Yay for clean dishes, but boo for trying to get to bed early.\n-The warning sticker. I still have not managed to get the residue off from the top of the machine where a big ‘ol yellow warning sticker was placed.\n-It does not have a flatware basket, but a grid. The flatware still gets placed vertically, but my dinner knives and dinner forks don’t actually fit.\n\nWhat I’m not sure about:\n-I’ve owned several Faberware products, and this is the first instruction manual where it is very obvious that it was written in another language, and then translated to English. There are a few grammar errors, and thought most meanings can be inferred, there are a couple of phrases that are incomprehensible.\n-I’m not a fan of the flatware grid- I saved the basket from the first countertop washer I had tried. (At least that experience wasn’t a total waste.) Otherwise, I’m sure that they can be found on Amazon.\n-I’m still not sure what all the modes are for. I don’t have to clean baby bottles, and I don’t think I’ll be putting my fruit in there. Air refresh? I have no idea.\n\nMy personal weirdness:\n-Since I fell in love with the Tank feature, and not having to use the water supply hose, I wanted to figure a way to reach the tank outlet at the back of the machine without having to pull the machine forward from under my cabinet in order to fill it up. I purchased a silicone dishpan with a drain (from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S737B7D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that sits on top of my machine, and I can fill the pan and allow the water to drip into the top of my machine without having to pull the machine out and push it back every time I use it.\n-I have only ever used liquid dishwasher detergent (Cascade Complete), which works really well for me, and I have never tried powder detergent.\n\nFinal take: To me, it was very much worth the money, and I do recommend.\nAttached are pictures of my machine, and scans from the Manufacturer’s Manual.\nI plan on stopping back to update this review over the next few months, and if any issues arise.",

        "content": "We original purchased this product for my elderly mother to help with her day to day. The word \"easy\" stands out.\n\nPlace it where ever you please as long as it properly has a place to drain to. Load it up, add detergent, close the hatch, turn on the unit, add water (or hook it up to your main line which is easier), then choose your dishwasher clean setting.\n\nPros:\nEasy to set up and use. My mother is elderly and is currently battling cancer. While she cooks for her husband and herself, she's able to load all her dishes and cooking utensils into the unit and just have it clean overnight. She gets tired from little day to day activities and while we're able to do as much as we can for her, she still wants and needs to do things independently.\n\nThe controls are easy understand. You can choose from various settings and it's easy to understand which button does what. The unit will beep and boop depending on what's happening (like when it's filled with enough water for a wash cycle or when a wash cycle is finished), which is a nice feature.\n\nIt uses jets that spray out from the bottom like the fountains you'd find at Las Vegas and cleans very well. We haven't seen any food particles or any remaining debris on the plates or glasses after months of use.\n\nAll dishwashers will need to empty themselves. While it's able to filter and drain out run off, larger particles and food debris will remain in the filter which was easy to remove, clean, and replace. I have hand dexterity issues while my mother is elderly so we were surprised at how easy this was to do.\n\nThere was no issues with drying. Although you have to turn on the fan option with each cycle, the dishes and utensils came out dry and honestly, better than other dishwashers (our household has gone through 2 large scale family dishwashers and this smaller unit seems better at drying than those larger ones).\n\nVery little detergent use. While most stores carry those detergent pods, you have to use loose detergent with this dishwasher. Overall, you'll be using less to clean.\n\nCons:\nSmall capacity. You won't be cleaning larger pots and pans in this thing. It's mostly made for smaller family units, college students, or the like. While my mom and her husband are able to use this freely and it meets their needs, others may find they need to use two or more wash cycles per day.\n\nIt's noisy. I would recommend using the dishwasher at night or before going to bed. While the fan is on to dry, you might hear a faint hum but it hasn't bothered us.\n\nIt uses a lot of water. With each cycle, you'll need to fill the unit up with the provided pitcher (or something similar). The unit will beep the moment it's full, but this can take up to four full pitchers to achieve. For myself, or anyone else, this can be time consuming and unwieldy as the take-in is at the top of the unit. We actually installed the fixed hose and I would recommend this option overall since it makes running the unit even more easier.\n\nThe dishwasher itself is bulky but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It needs to be close to the sink, or any other place it could drain to, but we had plenty of options in terms of placement with a generous hose length.\n\nOverall our family is happy with this product!",

        "content": "This is a great product! I read many reviews before I bought this and blew off the negatives I read about like the error messages from the unit and the need to call a plumber. While some of those issues may have indeed been unit failure--the majority probably were not.\nTips:\n1st (and most important): keep this unit on a curcuit with nothing else on it. If this unit shares a curcuit with a microwave, toaster, coffee maker, etc. this unit will fail. You will get error messages. Why? Because even though the curcuit does not kick the breaker the power is reduced to the unit causing it to fail. Simple as that. Frankly, I keep everything pluged in. I just make sure I only use one appliance at a time.\n\n2nd: Soap. If you use soap pods in this it will not give good results. Way too much soap and it will simply leave everything... well--soapy! I use Cascade gell just enough to fill the soap dish (which is about a tablespoon). Works great!\n\nThis seller stands by their product. I experienced the error messages on the unit I purchased so I quickly requested a replacement. They sent it with return postage paid and all. Very pleased with their response. However, I figured out there was nothing wrong with the original unit I had purchase but instead it was the electrical curcuit issue I described above in Tip #1.\n\nI give the seller 5 stars and the unit 5 stars.",

        "content": "For years I've been spraying my garden vegetable plants with hand spritzers. I apply water-diluted sulfur to my squash and melon leaves so they stay green and fresh, and water-diluted fertilizer to my tomato leaves. I need to spray both the tops and bottoms of leaves, but haven't been able to. I kept encountering the same problems with hand spritzers: spritzers that stop working all too soon; spritzers that will spray on tops of leaves, but not under leaves because they don't work when the nozzle is pointing upward; spritzers that can't fit in where I need to spray, so I can't get to the center of the plants; and spritzers that can't hold enough liquid to spray. I finally gave up and bought one of these. Before buying I could see I would be spraying with a wand, and that turned out to be ideal! I can spray in any direction (down or up) and I can reach in where I could not reach before. I'm not going back to hand spritzers!\n\nThe included assembly instructions seemed confusing because they are for a number of different models, which made it difficult to figure out what I was supposed to do with this specific 1-gallon product. Turns out assembly and use are easy if you follow these steps:\n\n1) Rinse out the jug. It may contain dust and bits left over from the manufacturing process.\n\n2) Insert the filter-end (perforated cylinder end) of the white plastic tube. This will go to the bottom of the interior of the jug.\n\n3) Secure the white plastic tube you just inserted, on the outside of the jug, with the threaded-fastener that's captive and sliding on the outer hose, put there for this purpose. You're making a water-tight seal, so make sure everything is first seated right, then twist the fastener snugly in place.\n\n4) Attach the wand on the other end of the hose. You are again using a threaded-fastener that is sliding on the hose, and you are again making sure everything is first seated well before twisting snugly in place.\n\nThat's it for the permanent assembly! For first-time use and to get a feel for how things work, fill the jug about 1/3 to 1/2 full with plain water. Drop the black pump into the top of the jug, with its handle on the outside. The handle is used to screw the pump into the jug so make sure the handle is down, into, and engaged in the top of the pump. Screw the pump in tightly since this has to be air-tight. Then unscrew the handle just a little, until it is loose and can be lifted up. Pump that handle to increase the pressure in the jug, and do it for longer than you might think necessary. Listen for leaking air where the pump is screwed in, and re-engage the handle into the pump to tighten it more if necessary.\n\nYou want a lot of air in the jug so you can pressurize it for a lot of spraying. If you fill the jug too high there may be too little air to pressurize, and you won't be able to spray that much since not a lot will come out. You'll have to interrupt with more pumping sessions to get the pressure back up along the way. There's no law against this, it's just inconvenient. Filling half way or less makes the whole setup lighter for use, too.\n\nThe wand has a handle you can squeeze, like at the gas pump, to get the spray going. Twist the end of the wand to change the shape of the spray, as you would with a garden hose.\n\nWhen you are done spraying, re-engage the pump handle into the pump, unscrew the pump and see and hear the pressure get released at the top of the jug around the edge of the pump.\n\nOK, you've gone through your practice session. Let's spray for real! Add water that dilutes what you are going to spray (use markings along the side of the jug to see 1-liter, 2-liters, quart, half gallon levels) and add your ingredient(s) to the water. You can shake the jug after it has been sealed and pressurized, then spray to your heart's content!\n\nDone for the day? Empty the jug and start again with plain water, then spray to clean everything out. I use this plain-water spray to water plants that could use it. Why waste the water?\n\nI am happy with my purchase, which is not something I always say. Of greatest importance? I see the effect on my plants!. Reliably getting to the undersides of leaves, and deep into bushy plants, are now easy, and really make a difference. They will for you, too.",

If it doesn't let you turn the pressure handle slightly left and try again. Once I figured it out it was a breeze! The amount of water that releases is a long stream and sufficient amount before you have to pump again. Overall it was a good buy!!

    "description": "Product Description\n\nThere’s only one Original Slinky Brand! Celebrate 75 years of wiggly-jiggly fun with Slinky! Generations of children and adults have loved playing with Slinky. This classic metal spring toy walks downstairs, alone or in pairs, and makes a slink-ity sound. First invented by mechanical engineer Richard James in 1943 during an experiment with tension coils. James accidentally dropped a spring on the floor and watched as it began to “walk.” Two years later, he introduced his walking spring toy in Gimbels Department Store during Christmas, and the Slinky immediately sold out. Since its debut, over 300 million Slinkys have been sold worldwide. In 2000, this classic toy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. Made 75 years ago, Slinky continues to be a favorite toy of children and adults all over the world. Slinky is fun for a girl or a boy and makes an ideal gift, stocking stuffer, prize, or present. Everyone loves a Slinky! Ages 5+",

It was almost like they were having more fun riding that damn slinky to the ground..

I've tried cooking oil, and though it was amusing to watch them pole dance, jump up, slide down, jump up, slide down, it only lasts for a day.\nI've tried habanero oil , and that lasts only until the seed get wets.\nBring in the slinky!\nIn order to get it on the double shepherds hook, I had to open it up like you would put a key on a key chain, and keep turing it until around and around until it was on the pole. I then made sure to leave a 4-5 loops around the top of the hook because I knew those tree rats were gong to put the slinky to the test.\nIt isn't 100% squirrel proof, as they do get lucky now and then and manage to get up the pole but I'm going through less bird seed than ever before!\nTotally satisfied!",

        "content": "I am 73 and my interest in propagating plants of all kinds began when I was in grade school. Since then, I have propagated a multitude of different varieties, both with and without using rooting hormones. Like all other living things, they have a desire to survive. The rooting hormone, though, is not a magic powder. You have to learn how to prepare cuttings, and each plant species can differ in the method or rooting medium used.\n\nMany of the soft stemmed plants root easily with or without a rooting hormone - for example basil, African violet leaves, or others with soft stems. For this type of cutting, it's a good idea to put a gallon baggie over the plant and pot to create a greenhouse effect, especially if the cutting has larger leaves. For plants that have woody stems, a rooting hormone helps a lot in the production of roots before the leaves dry out.\n\nFor all cutting, there are basic techniques that help to ensure success. Don't try to root a cutting that is too large as the leaves will die before the cutting can grow enough roots to support them. In general, a cutting should be no larger than 6-7 inches as the leaves should be removed from the bottom 3 inches or so. New roots will start growing at the leaf nodes (where the leaves come out of the stems). The very bottom of the cutting should be cut at a 45 degree angle as it allows more area for water absorption by the cutting. Soft stem cuttings do well in potting soil, but woody cuttings do better in a soil-less medium that retains moisture without being soggy or wet. A soil-less medium, such as coconut coir, also drains well. I don't recommend rooting cuttings in water since water roots are thicker and more fibrous than soil roots. When plants rooted in water are planted in soil, they have to grow new roots to adapt to living in soil. This usually isn't a problem for soft stemmed cutting that easily grow roots, but it can kill woody or hard-stemmed varieties.\n\nSince using this rooting hormone, I have rooted 36 Genovese basil cuttings, 12 pineapple sage cuttings, 5 rosemary cuttings, 5 thyme cuttings, 3 green sage cuttings, 2 lemon basil cuttings, and a number of cherry tomato cuttings. 100% of these cutting survived and grew. Prior to using this rooting hormone, I still had a good success rate with most of these, but the success rate was not quite as good. I also, had not tried to root some of the woody cutting, such as lemon basil, prior to getting this rooting hormone. By using this hormone, both of my lemon basil cuttings grew.\n\nTo put all of this in a nutshell, a rooting hormone of any kind is not going to magically work without proper preparation of the cutting, consideration of the plant species, and consideration of the best rooting medium for the species. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this rooting hormone as an aid to successfully rooting cuttings of any plant species.\n\nTo use this rooting hormone, simply prepare the cutting as described above, moisten the end of the cutting, dip it into the rooting powder, tap off the excess, insert the cutting at least 3-4 inches into the soil in a hole made by a pencil or potato baking stake, water until water comes out the bottom of the pot, and cover the cutting and pot with a gallon baggie that has holes cut at the top for air circulation. If done properly, the cutting may wilt the first couple of days, but it will come back as the roots develop.\n\nIf you grow herbs outdoors in the summer and want to have them available for the winter, this is a great way to produce new plants that can also be planted outdoors next summer. You will also have fresh herbs for the winter. I have included pictures of a few of the plants I have rooted using this hormone.\n\nUPDATE 7/27/21:\nI have been using this rooting hormone for over a year, and root quite a few cuttings rather than starting plants from seed since this produces larger plants more quickly. In this time, I have used less than half of the jar of rooting hormone. I have found that it is not at all necessary to dampen the stem of the cutting before dipping it into the powder. More than enough sticks to the stem, and it is still necessary to tap off the excess. Using this rooting hormone, I have had 100% success in rooting all of my cuttings. The latest cuttings I have rooted are thyme, lemon thyme, pineapple sage, rosemary, basil, Greek oregano, spicy oregano, Italian oregano, garden sage, and a few others. Rooting new plants with this hormone has been so successful, I would never use another one.\n\nI hope this review was helpful for you. I will update the review if I have other helpful ideas.",

        "content": "The Vortex Optics Solo Monocular is well made and has a quality feel to it. I bought the 10x36 configuration as I wanted the extra magnification (10x) and the larger objective lens size (36) to provide a slightly brighter image in lower light. The optical clarity is good with appropriate image brightness at most light levels, and no UV haze is evident.\n\nMy only critique is that the focus ring is a little stiff making one handed operation difficult. I also think the lack of lens caps is a design miss. This is an optical product and lens cleanliness is essential for proper operation. The product has a belt clip but I doubt most people will leave this swinging from their belt with no lens protection. Most people will likely feel inclined to leave it in the soft pouch for some basic protection making the belt clip pointless. The addition of lens caps that tethered to the body of the monocular would make the belt clip useful and improve the longevity of the product in my opnion.\n\nNot related to the product itself here are a couple of things to think about when buying a monocular: Do you really want a monocular? Optically, binoculars are superior in every way, the only real reason you should buy a monocular is for the reduced size and weight. If size and weight does not really matter to you buy binoculars (Vortex makes them also). Think about the magnification level you really need. The 10x is very hard to hold stable and this model does not have image stabilization. Getting closer to the object is not much good if the image is shaking around. If you don't have a steady hand or can't control your breathing (consider hiking or times of exertion) then consider getting the 8x not the 10x. The 8x offers good magnification suitable for most common uses but is much more stable. The 8x also offers a wider field of view making it easier to find something in the terrain, such as a bird in a tree. Higher magnifications assume you know what you want to look at!\n\nThis model comes in an objective lens size of 25 or 36. The 36 will be a little brighter and offer a larger exit pupil size than the 25. However the 36 is slightly larger, heavier, and has less eye relief when compared to the 25. The 36 is also more expensive. If your expected viewing is going to be bright daylight and size/weight matters, you probably only need the 25.",

        "content": "This is my first monocular, not my first experience with optics. After an extensive online search and gathering of information this one made it.\n\nAbout the product: I went for the 10x36. The feel in hand is very good, hard rubber gripy and sturdy in general, it seems well made, with good fit and finish. No protective caps is good for practical carry and quick use, bad for storage, transportation or for people who cares about maintaining gear in good condition, I personally miss the caps, not only for scratch protection but for keeping the glass clean of fingerprints, it's really annoying having to be careful at handling.\nI don't use the pocket clip so I dismounted it but it's good to have the option, it works. The eye relief is good with or without glasses. It works perfectly with Vankey cellphone adapter, it allows using the focus wheel while mounted. The focus wheel is a little stiff as I see in other reviews, it's true, it's a 2 hand operation but works well, although when turning the wheel all the way to both sides I can hear a \"sanding\" sound, like it's fragile, but this is an assumption. The optical experience is good, I'm glad I went with the 36 objective because the light gathering is better than I expected. I can see a clear an very defined image, with just a bit of blue glare at the edge of objects, but it's really hard to notice, not something that I consider a negative at this price point, moreover this happens only when the object is with heavy bright contrast at the background. Up to 100m the focus is excellent, past that distance the focus is very hard to find, it always seems tiny bit off focus, this is the main negative I've experienced so far. The second negative is a very very short range of focus, my guess is about 2m. I constantly find myself having to refocus.\n\nPersonal experience: The first time I use the cellphone adapter the eye relief plastic piece made a \"crack\" sound and came off. I red this in another review and it happened to me too. I found myself with the eye piece attached to the adapter in one hand and the monocular in the other with the glue exposed at the eyepiece, I thought it was over, but put it back together and it's like nothing happened. It's a very sticky soft glue I think that allows for this to happen but beeniusing it 2 weeks after that and it works fine.\nThere is no tripod mount but the monocular it's so light that I rather use the tripod attached to the cell phone adapter instead when digiscoping and works well.\nI own a pair of old Simmons binoculars 7x50, I believe they are from the 90s, these binoculars deliver exceptionaly good optics, a great field of view and very generous range of fucus, I could say 100m range of focus, so I'm used to that experience, that's why I can't enjoy the short range of focus of this monocular. The only downside to my binoculars is the weight.\n\nGeneral information: My options where between unknown (or barely known) Chinese brands and very expensive known and established brands. The expensive Leica and zeis where out of range mainly because I don't want to babycare gear, so I started looking at these chinese ones. It seems that all brands are the same, same factory, same quality control, etc. Only the marketing changes. Too many \"top 10 best monoculars\" videos that are obviously paid advertising. Product reviews by doubtful channels and lame or inexistant socialmedia presence. That doesn't give me so much confidence. In a deeper subject I red on a forum that chinese BAK4 is not really BAK4 and that there are not really any standards in the optics industry for using that term or the famous \"fully multi coated\". I'm aware Vortex are produced in China but there are some standards by well stablished brands. At least there is customer service and warranty. So I recommend to dig into this matter of optics specs and marketing schemes if you are really into optics.",

My main complaint is with the belt clip. Although you can remove the clip itself if you don't want to use it, you can't remove the mount point it attaches to. The mount point is poorly located and your fingers keep hitting it's hard edges. From a design perspective, this mount point should not even be needed, since there is already another mount point that sticks out (in a far better location) for the wrist strap. Other nit-picks include the case (poor quality) and lack of lens covers. Overall, I like this monocular and would recommend it to others.",

Eventually I began traveling, and one day came across a rock that reminded me of a toad, so I painted it that way using craft paints. I decided I wanted to paint scenes and portraits and miniature portraits, but at first I was terrible so I kept at it.\nI was fascinated by all the different kinds of rocks we came across in different countries, and by how the sky looked different all the time. I started watching tv shows like Bob Ross and other painters to learn about perspective. I checked books out of the library, and painted different scenes onto cool rocks my husband would lug in, God bless that man. Then I created my own scenes and portraits, often painting from my own photos, all using craft paint. I sprayed the completed, dried painting with sealant, some glossy, some flat. If you are interested in painting, just do it! You dont need a studio, just a table or desk. You dont need the right outside light, just buy a lamp that imitates sun\nlight. You may discover a wondrous deep well of creativity and freedom.\nTip: The 8 ounce bottle is often the better value over 2 ounce. You dont need a special pallet…u can use a paper plate to get started. If you take to it, as with most things in life, good tools are essential, and by that I mean good brushes.\nEnjoy!",

But if that can get the toughest job done, why wouldn't I just use a paper towel or dedicated cloth the whole time? If the food isn't coming out, just apply more force on the fingers.

        "content": "i got these for about $15 and they are the best ones we own! ive been back for more a few times (kids lose them) and this last time, they were on a black friday deal and i scored a few back up pair too!\n\nthe sound is good, the noise cancelation is enough that Id be able to get hit by the car behind me before I heard it but cant quite block out my kids screaming enough for me to ignore them fighting.. ya know, not $1000 buds but def $100 quality without that price on my walllet. ive had to take them out a few times to acknowledge things going on around me.\nbest part is, Im not even mad when the kids lose these.\n\nhere's some points we have noted:\nI use them at the gym every single day for any where from 1-2 hours, listen to music at work some days for an hour or so, talk on a few calls, my battery life works like this: I usually drop them in the case between uses and charge the case every 2-3 days. the case has not been out of power yet and the buds only ever got as low as the first warning beep one time when i used them almost the entire evening and into the night (think 5pm-11pm). tested them recently, they lasted over 4 days listening to them a lot. they charge up very quick. the call quality is great. never had anyone complain. im using them with an older dinosaur and a brand new galaxy s21, both run perfectly smooth and connect flawlessly. i love the announcements when i first pull them out and put them in my ears. also, my \"must have feature\" when i bought these was the individual capabilities and they are perfect on that point, better than others. i can control them seperately with no problem. i typically used just one all the time with my old pair to extened battery life but i have mostly used both with these.\n\nSide Note:\nI am just a normal, non tech person who loves listening to music for everything i do, hates listening to gym conversations and people who want to interupt my purpose, hates holding the phone to talk, and thinks people talking to themselves are hilarious. I cannot tell you the exact sound output and i did not time the usage or measure the battery output. i just know they work great for normal everyday usage and im not a brand \"wh**e\" so these are perfection to me and my wallet for a family of 5!\n\nprobably important to note the following:\n- they instantly paired to both of my devices when i opened them and took them out. my device only requires a quick search, click the product you want to pair, and approve the pairing on the phone. simple\n- i bought several pairs for members of my family who needed replacements and all of our pairs (except the pair witht he bad battery) work well, are the same quality, and seem to be the same battery quality\n- everyone from 10 years to 23 years, and the adults, are all happy with them\n- we are all droid users and some phones have no jack, while other can use wired buds also\n- we have tried expensive ones, wired ones, wireless in other brands, and other cheap sets and all of us have liked these as our #1 or #2 choice (one daughter liked the sound of a more expensive pair but that pair didnt have great battery either)",

        "content": "These are a typically great JBL product at their price point; the sound quality is very good for a value earbud. I find there to be an appropriate balance of treble/mids/bass out of the box, and I think that the highs are super crisp and bass can really boom. I find that they fit and seal well to stay snug in place and provide great passive noise-cancellation to block ambient sound. They're a little large, but I don't wear them for fashion, and I'm guessing the size helps with sound quality and power, as well as battery capacity. The battery life is very good, and it recharges quickly. I also personally prefer the hard button on the buds rather than a touch button. Overall, I really like these, especially having gotten them on a half off sale.\n\nHowever, I have 3 surprising issues with them I wish I'd known before buying... Lack of volume control, no incompatibility with the JBL app, and the case size/lack of lid.\n\nFirst, the buttons on the earbuds can't control volume, which makes absolutely no sense. Other JBL and earbud products allow volume control on one earbud and playback control on the other. These have the exact same functions on both left and right, which seems like a wasted opportunity. Also, that means the volume is entirely dependent on the source/playback device, and if the output from there is too loud/quiet for your preference, well.... you're stuck. With my phone, these earbuds were VERY loud even on the lowest volume setting possible. NOTE: I have a Samsung Galaxy (Gen 8), so I was able to go in and mess with the stock Samsung equalizer (Sound Settings > Advanced Sound Settings > Sound Quality and Effects) to turn the decibel levels way down and make them usable in all ambient settings. I was unsurprisingly unable to do this on my iPhone 11, though, as its Music EQ is very basic.... Android wins again! Regardless, I've read other customers have the same but opposite issue, where the earbuds are too quiet on the highest volume setting. Avoidable and frustrating, but potentially a work around for some.... The second problem is that there's no compatibility with the JBL app, which means you can't customize the EQ sound profile on less funtional playing devices (ahem, iPhone...) like you can with most newer JBL headphones, nor adjust the volume further, which is a feature I'd really appreciated with other JBL products. Lastly, a small thing: I find the charging case to be unnecessarily large and its lack of a lid a little unsettling. If the size means the charging capacity is greater, then that's fine, and the magnet is very strong and seems to hold them in well enough upside down and even when shaken violently, but the case is bigger than I want for pants pockets and I can see the earbuds being knocked loose and falling out in a bag/purse with other items.\n\nIn all, a solid buy, but there may be a newer version or another JBL product with similar sound/quality that have earbud volume control, app compatibility, and a better/smaller case that'd be preferable.",

He was so pleased with them, I tried them and immediately ordered a 2nd pair for myself.\n\nLIKES:\nObviously the price. Can’t beat $25\n\nSound: VERY impressed with the sound quality. I’m a huge hip hop/classic rock/audiobook fan. Great bass/CLEAR and CRISP. NO STATIC\n\nCalls: simple/intuitive. One touch answer/end call. Can hear perfectly well and no complaints on other end. SIRI/Alexa works no problem.\n\nFit: they fit very well and have S/M/L tips to ensure a snug fit.\n\nBattery: battery life is excellent. I get btw 4-5 hours music on full charge.\n—————\nDISLIKES: Not much to be honest. My list here is nit-picky considering the price but in the interest of keeping it real…\n\nANC: Don’t know why ppl are even mentioning Active Noise Cancellation. Not advertised. BUT: when you’re buds are in, it’s simply difficult to hear anything else. That being said, be careful while driving. You don’t need to have both in.\n\nNO TOUCH: This is the ONLY thing that is even moderately annoying about these. You have to physically press the button on the bud. When you do this you’re gently pushing the bud deeper in your ear. Not at all painful or anything but def would be nicer to have touch assist.\n\nVolume control: Have to alter on your phone/device. Again, not a deal-breaker by any means. No EQ but sound is great so I don’t care.\n\nCase’s cord: it’s about the length of my hand from wrist to tip of middle finger. Maybe 6 inches. Could def be longer. That being said, I keep the charging case in my center console so i don’t need the length. Some might find this frustrating though I’m sure.\nThe case itself is great, the magnets hood buds well, no issue.\n———-\n\nOVERALL: best wireless pod value on Amazon. USE EVERYDAY SINCE PURCHASED WITH NO ISSUES.\n\nPS. nice range too. Can leave phone in bedroom— walk the house/front and backyard without losing signal. When you do lose it, the buds will make a chime sound to let you know that you’re back in range.\n\nNO BRAINER FOR UNDER $30. If they were Touch assist with volume control i wouldn’t really have a thing to complain about at all.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n4/5 stars",

        "content": "I really like these headphones. I bought a cheap pair before these and every time I used headphones during a call I was told I sounded like I was underwater. So I gave these a try instead! The purple pair is such a nice color, the headphones fit my ears well and the buttons are very receptive (so I don't have to shove the whole thing into my ear to press it). The sound and mic quality are great, no complaints! The only complaint I do have about these headphones is the stupid case! What a bad design idea. Dropping the case (which leaves the earbuds completely uncovered to collect dust and crumbs from my purse) means that your earbuds just FLY in opposite directions. This particular feature is a gem when it's under 30°F and you drop the case, so your earbuds fly under 2 different cars in a parking lot. I will have to look into buying a case for my earbuds case which is just ridiculous -_-\n\nTL,DR: Great headphones, crappy open-top case design. If you're clumsy like me and drop headphones frequently, either avoid these or be prepared to chase your earbuds every time.",

It does start to hurt my ear after a while but I've never had anything not hurt when it is sitting in your ear for hours. It is very comfy for short term use (1-2 hours). I didn't realize they were noise canceling when I bought them so I have to take it out when talking to someone as it really does make a difference. I wish it had options to tap to pause the music so I wasn't having to take it out of my ear or scramble for my phone when I need to pause. Battery life is good, haven't had any complaints.

For some reason the left headphone dies while the right is fine. I’ve had to unpair and repair the headphones multiple times during a workout. If they’re not fully charged, the sound goes in and out. It also goes in and out if i don’t have my phone RIGHT next to me, even if it’s on the floor right in front of me. I wish I could return these, but unfortunately the time frame has passed.

This is my first Bluetooth earbud set so I don't know if they are unusually big but it would be nice if they were a little smaller. Only 3 sets of tips were included, 5 would be better because I think I would like larger ones. I was able to get a good ear seal but occasionally I get a snick sound as the rubber loses seal.\n\nSound-wise these are very smooth sounding with good balance from bass to high treble. The low bass is lacking however (I'm confident larger tips would not make a difference). If you are used to the ultra bass boost a lot of earbuds produce these will seem weak.",

It's totally dependent upon the device volume setting, so for instance if you're working out and want to turn the volume down for some reason, you are out of luck unless the device you're paired to happens to be at hand (in which case, why are you bothering with buds?) These NEED independent volume control. Otherwise, a great deal, good sound quality, I charged the device once so far, keep picking 'em up and using 'em without having yet had to recharge them.",

The noise cancellation, while not an included feature, is a feature. I barely turn the volume up one notch and every other noise disappears. It is worthwhile to try different earpieces to best fit your ears.

        "content": "I use Rit dye all the time, here are some helpful tips!\n\nStep by Step\nCHOOSING FABRICS. Rit works best on many natural, washable fabrics and materials, such as: a. 100% cotton, linen, silk, wool, ramie\nb. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon\nc. Fiber blends with at least 60% cotton or other dyeable fiber (blends will tint evenly but will not achieve full color)\nd. Nylon-based plastic such as those found in buttons, fasteners and lacrosse sticks\ne. Natural materials such as wood, wicker, paper, feathers and cork But there are fabrics and materials that will not accept dye, such as: a. 100% polyester, acrylic, acetate, fiberglass, spandex and metallic fibers\nb. Fabrics with rubber backing (bath mats or throw rugs)\nc. Fabrics with special finishes such as water repellents\nd. Fabrics with bleach damage or extensive staining\ne. Fabrics washable only in cold water or labeled “dry clean only”\nf. Polyethylene plastics such as golf discs\ng. Polycarbonate plastics such as eyeglass frames\nFiber content and weight also effect how color appears making fabrics like cotton, wool and silk absorb dye differently, slightly changing the hue and brightness of the chosen color. If you are in doubt as to whether your fabric will accept dye or achieve the color you want, we recommend testing a swatch.\nDYE PREP. Cover work area with a plastic table cover or newspaper and have paper towels or sponges handy to protect against any possible spills.\nWear rubber gloves to protect hands from getting stained and to insulate them when working with hot water.\nUse plastic buckets or stainless steel pots for the dye bath. You can also dye in a stainless steel sink. Don’t dye or rinse items in a porcelain or fiberglass sink or tub as they are likely to get stained./p>\nACHIEVING TRUE COLOR. Always follow manufacturer’s care instructions for your fabric as well as Rit Dye package or bottle instructions.\nRemove stains on fabric or use Rit Color Remover before dyeing to get fabric to an off-white or cream color. This will help achieve uniform color results when dyeing.\nDissolve powder dye thoroughly in 2 cups of very hot water first to avoid dye spotting. Stir dissolved powder dye or well-shaken liquid dye into dye bath until evenly dispersed. Never pour liquid or powder dye directly on fabric unless looking to achieve a specific creative effect.\nBe sure to use enough dye for the weight or size of the project. For example, for a pound of dry fabric (about 3 yards), use one package of Rit powder or 1/2 bottle of Rit liquid in 3 gallons of water. You want enough water for the fabric to move freely in the dye bath so that it can absorb the dye evenly across the garment.\nWhen dyeing 1 pound of dry fabric in dark or bright colors such as Black, Dark Brown, Cocoa Brown, Navy, Purple, Wine, and Dark Green, use double the amount of dye (2 packages of Rit powder or 1 bottle of Rit liquid) in 3 gallons of water.\nFor the deepest color, use a water temperature of 140ºF/60ºC and keep heat constant while dyeing (the stove top method or a washing machine work best). Note: If tap water is not hot enough, heat water on the stove, in a teakettle or in the microwave.\nIf dyeing a garment more than one color, it’s usually best to start with the lightest color and move to the darkest.\nFor more intense color when dyeing fabrics containing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup salt to the dye bath. When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup white vinegar to the dye bath. If possible delay adding the salt or vinegar until 5 minutes after the fabric has been in the dye bath. The delay will help to promote level dyeing.\nAdd 1 tablespoon laundry detergent to all dye baths to help promote level dyeing.\nThe longer the garment is immersed in the dye bath, the deeper the resulting color. Items can remain in the dye bath up to 1 hour as long as the water remains hot. You’ll also have to make sure the item receives constant agitation or stirring.\nGarments will also look darker when wet and prior to washing.\nWhen you remove clothes from dye bath, rinse in warm, then cool water until water runs clear. (Warm water helps to rinse off surface dye more effectively.)\nWash your fabric/clothes in warm water with mild detergent and then rinse thoroughly in cool water. Machine dry or hang dry.\nCARING FOR DYED ITEMS. For the first two or three times, wash your dyed item by itself in cool water with a small amount of non-bleaching detergent. Always wash your dyed clothing with similar colors in cool water with mild detergent. Dry cleaning silks and special fabrics is recommended.\nCLEANUP. Clean containers and sinks immediately after dyeing by scrubbing with hot water and powdered cleanser or bleach.\nClean washing machine using highest water level with hot water, detergent and 1 cup chlorine bleach using complete wash cycle. Clean lint traps. Plastic or rubber machine parts may be tinted but will not stain laundry.",

        "content": "I had purchased this item back in January for my 1BR apartment. Aside from the color, it was perfect (I ordered black but it arrived in aquamarine, oh well). By August, I noticed it started to rust, but it still worked. And finally, at the end of November, it stopped working. It would still turn on, still lit up green but that's about it. It was perpetually stuck on the \"it's full\" when it was most certainly not even making ice. I unplugged it. Drained it. Dried it out. And whatever free time I had to spare I spent trying to locate customer service. Alas, 7 working useful months was all I got. I think what makes it worst is the lack of customer service. Under amazon, my product support ended in June (or July).\n\nEdit:\nI'm changing my rating since they did issue me a refund and were very nice.\nThis is the email to contact them support@curtiscs.com\nI emailed them my order number, date of purchase, amount and indicated it was from Amazon. They will then email you back with instructions. Instructions include what pics they need of the unit in question such as angles and the unit number. They will also instruct you whether or not to ship the unit back to them. In full transparency, I DID ship it back to them on my expense (I think I paid $50+ for shipping). Process takes a while. They will then decide whether to give you a refund or send you a new unit. I got my refund (price of the unit NOT shipping). I didn't mind paying for shipping so this was a non-issue to me. Overall, I'm just glad it's now resolved.",

        "content": "Only two weeks in, but the memory card seems to working great.\n\nI got this card for my kindle as it was specifically recommended by Amazon, and my kindle came with only 8 gigabytes of storage, which is ridiculously insufficient for any modern complex operating system expected to accumulate data. Even worse, it's not really 8 full gigabytes. (Also, I got tired of being nagged about running out of space after taking only a few dozen photos.)\n\nComputers like numbers that are in powers of 2, and work best with processors and RAM that are built on powers of 2, which is why you usually see numbers like 8, 16, 32, etc. and not \"strange\" numbers like 10, 21, 43, etc. For this reason computer systems have *traditionally* used 1024 (2^10) as a base when reporting storage usage in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.\n\nWhen it comes to a physical storage medium, however, capacity does not have to be a power of 2; it can be whatever number of storage positions will *physically fit*, the only real requirement being that the computer processor can count that high.\n\nManufacturers are notorious for cutting corners in manufacturing wherever possible then hyping up their products. In the case of the kindle, Amazon used 1000 (10^3) as the base of its \"8 gigabyte\" claim and aimed for a physical arrangement that would guarantee *at least* 8,000,000,000 bytes of storage (1000*1000*1000*8), over half a billion bytes short of 8,589,934,592 (1024*1024*1024*8). Not surprisingly, SanDisk did the same thing with this less-than-32-gigabyte memory card, as this deceptive practice has become an industry standard. But I digress a bit, my point being that an 8-gigabyte kindle affords you with MUCH less storage space than you would expect, necessitating a memory card for expanded storage, especially since the kindle's operating system uses a LOT of overhead, and every application you install also wants to use a lot of storage.\n\nWhen inserting your new memory card (or removing it) it is best to do so while the device is turned off. Mobile devices are finicky when it comes to \"hot swapping\" memory cards, often refusing to read the card, or even worse, damaging the card and corrupting data.\n\nAfter you've inserted the card and turned the kindle back on, go to Settings -> Storage, and move all the option sliders to the right to tell your kindle to utilize the memory card as much as it is willing to. Unfortunately, some features will still waste space on the internal storage, e.g. screen captures and blue tooth file transfers will NOT be saved to the memory card.\n\nTo \"move\" my kindle books to the memory card, the easiest way was to delete them then re-download them. To move other personal files to the memory card, I connected my kindle to my PC and used Windows Explorer.\n\nFrom the previously mentioned settings menu, you can also move *some* applications to the memory card. Before and after the move, the amount of storage used on each disk is displayed. Moved applications will still use *some* space on the internal storage, and funnily enough, moved applications use more TOTAL storage than when they resided solely on the internal storage.\n\nOne application I did NOT move was ES File Explorer, as this is a system-critical application (due to the kindle's shortcomings).\n\nIt should also be noted that the kindle's crappy built-in file browser CANNOT locate the memory card. The files *are* there, but you will NOT find them without a proper file browser like ES File Explorer. Also, some programs (such as the red Notepad) will not be allowed write permissions to the memory card!\n\nA few days ago my wife turned on my kindle and it updated itself which took over half an hour, which seemed unusual because when I observe updates they tend to run much faster. Afterward, my kindle stopped recognizing the presence of the memory card. The solution was to turn off the kindle, remove the card, turn the kindle on, then back off, then reinsert the memory card, then turn the kindle back on.\n\nThe card is working great, and is less than 3% full while my kindle has less than 1.5 gigabytes free.\n\nUpdate 2018-04-23\n\nLast night just before I went to bed, my kindle battery was running low. I was too lazy to go find a charging cable, so I just turned the kindle off.\n\nThis morning I turned it back on, with only 12% battery power remaining, and found that several program icons were dark. When I tried to launch one of them, I was told that the program couldn't run because the memory card could not be found! I tried removing the memory card and restarted the kindle like I described in my original review, but the memory card could STILL not be found.\n\nI took the memory card out and connected it to my desktop computer and confirmed that it was in perfect working order. I then put it back in the kindle and connected the kindle to my computer, letting the charge process turn the kindle on. The darkened icons were still dark, and I saw a flash of the memory card icon at the top-left of the screen. I opened ES File Explorer which located the memory card and showed me its files. I went back to the home screen and none of the icons are dark any more.\n\nI guess my piece-of-crap kindle doesn't want to exert any effort accessing the memory card if the battery power is red-lining when the device boots up.",

        "content": "The card being said from Amazon: was created for the Kindle Fire, but after you buy one, the proof is in the pudding!!!. There is so many options you find for this card after you install your: SanDisk 128 SD Memory Card to your KINDLE Fire. Besides all the options you will have, when you go to check out the card in your \"Apps and Games\" area after it's in, it has it's own area next to: downloaded app, then you will see \"apps that can be movied to the SD Card\" that's built right in so you want need a app to move things to your new card. It show you a list of the apps you have on your system that can be moved to SD card, or not. Some apps are not movable, and that's ok! The ones that are not able to move are not supposed to be moved for the reason, they need to read things out side of the card. Some give you options to move anyways, but will tell you that you will not be able to use widgets and other objects, etc, etc. Just don't get a SD App and try to force things in to the card that shouldn't be moved. I find also that my Kindle Fire is faster adding everything to the card, so that's a big plus, even my browser is faster, but we do use Chrome. The reason you hear that 1-to-2% having problems with this card besides coming to the realization after they buy a 128GB card, and see they could have bought a much smaller one since they had plenty of room to begin with. Most also are not waiting for the card to get everything lined up to work correct. Let me explain: Just like you should give time for the Kindle Fire to load correctly, also give your new card time to load, because besides it getting everything ready for you to use it, and carrying a ton of information at 128 GB, it's also checking to see if there are any other apps that need to be moved as it starts up, etc. It's not just a board with apps pinned to it, there is allot of information it is checking on, and also depends on where you added things from, so it can be checking allot of different areas too, thanks to Kindle Fires Åwesomeness!!! You can tell when it's ready, because the Icons on your desktop will turn dark to normal till it's ready to go, so don't be like the 1-to-2%, be smart, be patient!. Did you ever wonder why there are only a few who complain about objects we buy? Well besides they can't spell correctly? There the one who break things screwing around, because if they can't spell, there sure not going to read, and that makes them not patient enough and they think they must complain to get there money back. Being the CEO of \"MUST HAVE\" Åpps, and Supplies,™ we test ever item for a few weeks inside and out!. We add tons of info, then remove it all, just to add it back in again to see if the card is worthy enough 4Ü! We add all kinds of movies, docs, etc, then check to see how everything came out in the end. The more you use your card, and learn to 're-boot after your last app is installed for that day, the faster your card will be because it's lined up and clean with nothing to stop it. We are just like computers, they need to be rebooted after every download, and so does a Kindle Fire, it needs to be 're-booted after adding anything, and hard-booted if you ever have a problem. If you do not know this, you will be that 1-to-2% with problems because you never took time to read about your KINDLE Fire. That's the first two things you must learn besides cleaning your cache, and making sure you have no malware in your Kindle Fire. These four things are a \"MUST\" TO KNOW, and that way you can give great reviews too when done :-). Also, the reason we say this is for a: Kindle Fire 5TH Gen 10.1 is we tested this card on one. So those with a 5TH Gen who been looking to find the right 128 GB Micro Card, look no further!. Also, we do not get paid for our reviews, we started \"MUST HAVE\" for the people that are too busy in a day to wonder what the best is for there system, or the novice who wants what the pro's use. We take on all the testing for you, it's our way of giving back to the world. We have a major following and get hundreds of letters each week asking for reviews, but I tell them this: If we feel it does not make 5 star, and find the item has problems, we then will not leave a review, we will tell you instead what wrong with the product or app, and leave the review for another since we only do 5 Star items, and you know what? Most say: that's all we want, honesty!. There is always better out in the world of course, but this passed with flying colors and works great for me and my team!!! Most want to know what we use on our Kindle Fire's, and as far as Micro SD Cards go, this is it!!!..\n\nRemember always! Life is EZ! For those who SEEK! Especially when it comes to all there \"MUST HAVE\" Åpps, and Supplies™..\n\nTake it from me (CEO)EZ-SEEK.\nDon't delay! Buy your card Today! At: Amazon.com\n\nTHE KING OF KINGS IS COMING!

When i installed it, the card properly \"clicked\" in as it should have but when I powered the tablet back up, the new card did not pop up as sucessfully installed as other users had mentioned. When I went to the storage folder in the settings, it showed the card as corrupted. I tried physically removing it and reinstalling several times but each time it still showed as \"corrupted\" in the settings/storage.\n\nI contacted the seller who immediately sent a replacement card. I carefully installed it but it still showed as corrupted. Frustrated, I clicked on where it said \"corrupted\" in the settings/storage folder to see if maybe it would give me some more information, though I wasn'e expecting anything because it didn't look like a link and was suprised when this action caused a message to pop up that said that the new card would need to be formatted to work and did I want to format it now? Well of course I did. I formatted it as internal storage and transfered the recommended apps there and it was installed. It would have been tremendously helpful if the formatting option appeared under or near the \"corrupted\" message.\n\nI feel bad that I had to return the first one to the seller but wanted to share this in case anyone else is receiving the \"corrupted\" message.",

(My last phone was a Samsung S8 Active, also in a Spigen Tough Armor case, but with no PopSocket or MagSafe features).\n\nI like the feel/added sense of a better grip on my phone. The PopSocket PopGrip is just enough to add a more secure grip, particularly in cold weather or when wearing gloves.\n\nOne feature in particular that I find convenient is the ability to rather easily remove the MagSafe PopSocket PopGrip. It MUST be removed if a wireless charger is used for the phone, but it is easy to remove from the phone, and even easier to replace it.\n\nBoth the Spigen Tough Armor MagSafe case and the PopSocket MagSafe PopGrip include features that serve as a \"kickstand\" for the phone. However, if the PopSocket PopGrip is attached to the phone, it prevents the use of the Spigen kickstand. While the PopSocket MagSafe PopGrip is easy to remove, some folks might consider 2 kickstand features as redundant/unnecessary. If so, they should consider a different case. Personally, I have no problem with the \"redundancy\". However, be aware that the kickstand in the Spigen case only allows for it to be used in landscape mode, and only when the PopSocket PopGrip is not attached. The PopSocket PopGrip works best with the phone in landscape mode, but can be reversed if the charging port needs to be oriented in a particular direction.\n\nWith both the Spigen Tough Armor MagSafe case and the PopSocket MagSafe PopGrip, I feel my new iPhone 14 Pro is pretty well protected. If you're looking to protect an investment in an expensive smart phone, I would recommend both.",

        "content": "Archer A7/AX21 2.4G speed for iPhone 11 from 300M Verizon Fios\n\n5* review for successfully resolved my low 2.4G speed problem, excellent support from TP Link and fast 5G speed that exceeds Verizon Fios max speed of 300Mbps.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to compare the 2.4G and 5G speeds of the TP Link Archer A7(AC1700) WiFi 5 router and AX21(AX1800) WiFi 6 router using an iPhone 11 which supports WiFi 6. The highest speed I can test is 300Mbps limited by my Verizon Internet plan. Measurement results using show that using the WiFi 5 router, the 2.4G speed is 60M/80M (UL/DL) and the 5G speed is 307M/330M, whereas using the WiFi 6 router, the 2.4G speed is 110M/120M and the 5G speed is about same.\n\nNewer routers’ real life 5G speed is very high and normally is not a problem, but real life 2.4G speed could be slow. It is not entirely sure which part of the wireless link is limiting the 2.4G speed. Below examines the speed limit of the WiFi standards involved, the router and iPhone 11. The routers are TP Link’s Archer A7(AC1700) and AX21(AX1800). Measured speeds at 2.4G and 5G will also be given.\n\nRouter (TP Link) Specs and Supported WiFi Standards\n1) Archer A7(AC1700) has has 3 antennas is a WiFi 5 router\n2.4G : 450Mbps\n5G: 1300M bps\nSupported Standards: AX21(AX1800) : 802.11ac(Wi-Fi 5), 802.11b, 802.11ax(Wi-Fi 6), 802.11n(Wi-Fi 4), 802.11g\n\n802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax are also called Wi-Fi 4, WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 respectively.\n\n2) AX21(AX1800) has 4 antennas is a WiFi 6 router\n2.4G: 574M bps\n5G: 1200M bps.\nSupported Standards: AX7 (AC1700) 802.11b, 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11ac\n\nA7 (AX1800) is a low cost ($60) popular (listed as “Amazon Choice”) WiFi 5 router which supports 802.11 ac whereas AX 21 is a low cost ($90) WiFi 6 router which supports 802.11 ax. WiFi 6 (max speed 9.6G) not only has higher speed than WiFi 5 (max speed 3.5G) but also can support more devices using orthogonal frequency division multiple access. The main differences are given in picture 1.\n(Picture 1 from : https://www.mwrf.com/technologies/systems/article/21849959/whats-the-difference-between-wifi-5-and-wifi-6)\n\nComparing the specs of these two routers, one has a higher 2.4G speed while the other has a higher 5G speed. But in real life, according to my measurements, at 2.4G, the WiFi 6 router has almost twice the speed than the WiFi 5 router. I don’t have a high enough wireless speed plan to test the 5G speed. In my house both routers have the same speed of 310M, limited by the max speed allowed by Verizon Fios 300M.\n\nSpeeds specified by the WiFi standards are speeds the router manufacturers trying to meet and they are not the limit, but speeds advertised by the router are the speeds that customers want the router to be able to reach. They become upset if they are unable to get the speeds advertised by the router.\n\nRouters often do not specified under what link conditions these seemingly advertised high speeds could be realized. For example what is the required bandwidth, the number of antennas (the so called MIMO) and how pure the signal has to be (the signal to noise ratio). Is the bandwidth 20, 40, 80 or 160M? Is the signal to noise ratio has to be greater than 10dB?\n\nIn real life, link speed depends on how far from the router (the signal strength) and radio interference which falls in band (the signal to noise ratio). The former can be solved by doing the speed test right next to the router, where the transmit signal from the router is at maximum. But for the latter, unless one has a so called Faraday Cage, there is no way to block in-band interference especially at 2.4G, which are used by microwave ovens, Bluetooth and many household devices. Interference is hard to quantify without using a spectrum analyzer and could become an excuse if one calls the router support line complaining low speed.\n\nAnother limit is the device itself, and in this case iPhone 11. It’s specs are given below.\n\nWi-Fi specifications for iPhone 11\n802.11 standard, name, frequency Maximum PHY data rate Maximum channel bandwidth Maximum MCS index Maximum spatial streams\nax@5 GHz 1200 Mbps 80 MHz 11 (HE) 2/MIMO\nac@5 GHz 866 Mbps 80 MHz 9 (VHT) 2/MIMO\na/n@5 GHz 300 Mbps 40 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO\nax@2.4 GHz 195 Mbps 20 MHz 9 (HE) 2/MIMO\nb/g/n@2.4 GHz 144 Mbps 20 MHz 7 (HT) 2/MIMO\n(From: https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/iphone-wi-fi-specification-details-dep268652e6c/web)\n\nhttps://mcsindex.com gives more details about how the speed on each band is affected by modulation scheme, number of antennas, bandwidth and WiFi standards used, not only for iPhones but for routers as well.\n\nFrom the iPhone 11 specs, only “n” and “ax” support 2.4GHz if we ignore the older standards “b” and “g”. At 2.4G, The maximum speeds for “n” is 144M whereas for “ax” is 195M. The max bandwidth for both is 20MHz which needs to be set in the router. Setting the bandwidth to 40MHz could lower the speed as the noise power will be doubled.\n\nHowever, at 5GHz the speed for ac (WiFi 5) is 866M with 80M max bandwidth whereas for ax (WiFi 6) is 1200M also with 80M max bandwidth. These bandwidths should also be specified in the router. Setting the bandwidth too high or too low could lower the speed.\n\nFrom the iPhone 11 max speeds, it is clear that the wireless link’s speed is not limited by both the A7 and AX21 routers and the standards, but by the iPhone 11 at 2.4G and by Verizon Fios at 5G.\n\nI have Verizon Fios 300M download and upload. Initially, I used an A7, thinking that at 2.4GHz, the router speed is 450M which is higher than iPhone’s 144M(“n”) and 195M(“ax), surely shouldn’t be a problem. But speed test showed that I got only 60M download and 80M upload from the best channel and 20M bandwidth (I tested all the channels and bandwidth combinations).\n\n60M is too slow for me because I have several devices (such as security cameras) using 2.4G. So I called TP Link support line to see what I had done wrong. Most customer supports didn’t know what the problem was the and finally I was connected to a high level support. She said that in real life, I had to multiply the speed by 30-50% and guided me through the various specs of the wireless link. I don’t know where the 30-50% comes from, perhaps it was her empirical experience. If I use the average of 40% and assume that applies to the lower speed of the router and the iPhone, which is 144MHz. 40%x144M is 57M. This was about what I got at 2.4G using the A7 router.\n\nBut she also said something about WiFi 6 router and got me thinking perhaps a WiFi 6 router could improve the speed. (I must say that I got excellent support from TP Link, I had gotten calls twice from the specialist unsolicited and many followup emails. All trying to help me solve the low speed problem.)\n\nI then change the A7(AC1700) to an AX21(AX1800), which does support WiFi 6 “ax”.\n\nThe main advantage of using AX21 is that it raised the iPhone 11 max speed at 2.4G from 144M to 195M, a gain of 51M. And as a result, in real life, the 2.4G link speed seemed to have increased by about the same amount. Speed test showed that at 2.4G, I now got ~90-110M(download, previously 60M when using A7) and 100-120M(upload) with the channel and bandwidth set on auto. Though the download speed is still less than 195M, the link speed has increased by changing to a router that supports ax and has 4 antennas. Have no idea if a more expensive router will further increase the 2.4G speed.\n\nHowever, at 5GHz, both routers give 307M download and 330M upload, limited by Verizon Fios max speed of 300M.\n\nWhen doing speed test, I shut off all 2.4G emitters. I live in a rural area and I suspect there is little interference.\n\nA7 has 3 antennas whereas AX21 has four. Is the speed improvement at 2.4G due to the additional antenna or the support of WiFi 6 or both?",

        "content": "I would consider myself a novice when it comes to routers and networking. I can do simple tasks (network set up) adding removing devices..etc changing passwords etc. For the past few months, i have been on the fence about replacing my ISP provided router, so i took the plunge and orderd this model (archer ax21).\nmy old netgear router (supplied by my ISP (charter spectrum) died back in november and I called customer service and they sent me a new \"advanced wifi\" router. that router was complete garbage, ISP's don't even let customers go in and modify their own home wi-fi networks. if you type the ip address for the router, it directs you to a page that says \"login using the spectrum app\". well, their app only allows you to change the SSID name and password..NOTHING ELSE. very frustrating. ISP provided routers now combine the 2.5ghz and 5ghz bands, and many of my devices are older and ONLY use the 2.5 ghz band. so, natrually there were conflicts and frequent disconnects. I also own a accurite iris 5 and 1 weather station. in all my years of using a pc and wireless networks.. I have never seen or had a device that is so tempermental. I needed to be able to isolate the 2.5ghz and 5ghz bands so that i could assign specific devices to each band. the older things go on the 2.5ghz, and newer things like ipad, smart tv, xbox one..go on the 5ghz band.\n\nsetting this up was very straight forward. simply power down your ISP modem, and reboot. wait for everything to reboot and ensure you have internet connectivity through the modem. then plug ethernet cable from back of modem into the WAN port on the Archer X21 router. then power up the router and wait for all the lights to turn green. takes about 1-3 minutes tops.\nyou can set up either via APP (which is what i did), or you can set up using pc with ethernet cable.\nI have a chromebook, so it has no eithernet jack. i actually ordered one on amazon, it's a usb to ethernet adapter. works like champ. but for most people you should be able to set up just using the app.. if you want to do more advanced things (dchp customizations, etc) i would set it up on the webpage through the ethernet connection.\nsimply follow the instructions from the app, enter your new network name and new password and you will be good to go.\nthe app shows each device connected on each network as well as real time uploads/downloads so you can see if there is a issue with a particular device. if you are having issues with devices disconnecting/reconnecting/slow speeds etc. i would suggest at the start that you DISABLE the 5ghz band. after you get everything connected and confirm that the devices are working, then go ahead and re-enable the 5ghz band. for some reason, (not sure why) on inital setup there can be conflicts.\nthere are tons of options for this router, far to many to get into much detail for this review. go ahead and download the manual prior to purchase, so you can read up on what this router can/can't do before you purchase.\nyou can actually update the firmware over the air by hitting the update button, or you can speciify a certain time of day for the updates to be installed. a good rule of thumb would be set it to sometime after midnight that way, you will be asleep more than likely when the updates happen. out of the box, mine needed a firmware update. took less than 5 minutes.\ni've had/currently have other tp-link products (smart bulbs/cameras) and they all work as expected.\nthe app is very intuitive and straight forward. i didn't have to have any special settings from my ISP, i just plugged in the router, went through the setup, and everything connnected flawslessly on the FIRST attempt. no errors/timeouts etc that i was getting with my ISP supplied router.\nthe router is sleek and has 4 antennas. my range is about the same as with my previous isp supplied router. currently have a linksys re6300 extender out here in the living room to boost the 5ghz band. my house isn't that big but is very old. (its a single wide from early 70's with A-Frame roof). so i think my signal loss has alot to do with the aluminum siding on my house. your range/results will obviously vary.\nI currently have 16 devices on my network and all are staying connected flawlessly and seem faster than with the ISP supplied router.\nthere is also a option for guest network. I'm using that for guests and my accurite weather station.\nhoping this will help me troubleshoot the accurite when the inevitable disconnects start.\nalso wanted to mention that the accurite iris 5-1 weather stations are full of problems. if your considering one, go with another brand. it's not worth the headache.\nthe only reason i took a star off was becase the antennas on the back of the router were wrapped in plastic that was hard to take off. other than that, i think this router is perfect. it's affordable, has tons of options and doesn't have performance issues that ISP supplied routers do. pick one up today, i'm sure glad I did.",

        "content": "Functions as advertised. Being advanced user I would prefer a little more granularity in the advanced configuration menus but the bottom line for this router is that is the best bang-for-the buck (i.e. value for your money) you are going to find in a WiFi 6 dual band router, taking into account stability of operation. There may be some competitors in the price range but check the reviews for user comments about stability such as need for rebooting every so often. This AX21 has gone over 30 days without reboot and is performing as perfectly as it did right after that last reboot. Now, I did have an issue initially that caused me to down rate this router initially, but that turned out to be a rather dumb error in configuring it right out of the box. Once I caught that I meant to update my review but got sidetracked and so am now just updating it to give this router the credit it deserves. House is a single level 1800 sq ft living space plus approx 800 sq ft three and half car attached garage. The garage floor is sealed and the exterior walls and overhead doors insulated to make the garage usable as extra space for the home in add'n to containing vehicle and motorcycle (seal coated floor). My point here is the AX21/600X combo covers the entire structure both living space and the garage with garage featuring a streaming client (4K TV). The signal strength admittedly is down to approximately half at farthest point in garage but that is still impressive at the price point of this Wifi 6 mesh network setup using only one extender (the RE600X). Other side of the kitchen wall (exterior wall) that the 600X is plugged into is a small in-ground pool area and the AX21/RE600X mesh network signal is no less that about 75% strength out there. These results are nothing short of phenomenal in my opinion at the price point, but admittedly I got both for around 20% off each during Holiday season discounts by the TP-Link Store here on Amazon. And again, the stability is commendable-- these two devices working together in the OneMesh configuration just keep on keeping on, with no throughput or latency issues in over 30 days on un-rebooted use. If you saw my RE600X review you may note comment on long reboot time and think my statements are not consistent, but take heart: that observation was during the initial setup of the RE600X and is not relevant to my statement that the pair have not required a reboot since. One caveat: The household consists of just two persons, and device load on the network is rarely more than 3 or 4 devices actively using wifi data at same time. Your mileage may vary with higher device load on this same setup.\n\nOne final note about the AX21 WiFi 6 router. It accepts prime number Beacon Intervals without issue. I am currently using a Beacon Interval of 167 and DTIM of 1 and have found this to be the sweet spot between throughput, latency, and client battery drain for this router. My previous router was a TP-Link Archer C7 Wifi 5 and 127 was it's sweet spot for Beacon Interval. I utilize a prime number Beacon due to local crowding on the 2.4ghz medium in my neighborhood.\n\nHard to go wrong with the AX21/RE600X combo if you have a small to medium living space !!",

        "content": "Now I have to say up front I was close to regretting getting the Archer AX21. I had it up and running in about 5-10 minutes but, for the first 5 days the wifi devices using it were losing their internet connection multiple times a day and the only way to resolve it was to rebooting the modem. I started to think maybe some of the bad reviews here were true.\n\nI started checking settings, reaching out to TP-LINK (great response form them) and to Motorola, for my cable modem/router combo settings. Turns out I did not have the Motorola device correctly set for WLAN and Bridge mode (note, the AX21 setup even sees another router and suggest placing the other into Bridge mode, it's just that the Motorola modem required another set to configure the WLAN). Once that was set the router has been up and running and devices working with it for a week now with no issues. TP-LINK also had me change some of AX21 internet settings, which I first thought may be part of the issue, but since correctly setting the modem I have changed the AX21 settings back and it still works fine.\nThe wifi coverage on the AX21 is great. My 100yr old house has plaster walls and large central brick chimney. The cable modem/router is set up in a back room/office but it had weak coverage to the opposite end of the house even with the TP-Link extender I already had. I ran cabling to place the AX21 in the living room, near the center of the house. Once set up, the coverage is great. I like that I was able to change the extender to OneMesh mode and move to another corner of the house to improve outside coverage for some external security cameras and have one wifi ssid throughout; the dual mode also split out the 2.4ghz (used by the security system) and the 5ghz used by our tablets and phones. The only wifi version 6 devices we have are our phones and yet on a speed test on all of our wifi devices were able to get the full speed of our cable internet service. The AX21 and one the one indoor OneMesh extender even covers our entire very large backyard.\nNote: If I had wanted to keep using the wifi capabilities of my existing modem/router device, I could left the modem in its default settings and set up the AX21 in access point mode, but I would lose the OneMesh capabilities I wanted for a single network with at least one extender, and my older modem combo only had 2.4ghz, so best for me to use the AX21 as a router and it’s full capabilities.\nI also like the web admin console and the tether app for the degree of control they provide, from features like checking clients connected and reserving IP addresses to little things like being able to schedule device lights off at night.",

        "content": "Long review but hopefully helpful:\n\nBought this to replace an aged Airport Extreme and give my Oculus Quest 2 a better WiFi connection. So far so good.\n\nSet up was okay but I had some trouble getting the Ethernet light to go green despite all the others being green and I was unable to get online via wired or wireless connection. If you reboot your modem and this device, go make coffee or something when it is starting back up because the router takes a while to restart. The light finally went green but it did feel like it took an inordinate amount of time.\n\nI understand the frustration that comes with setting up these new things and the rage factor sometimes enters the picture. If it does: unplug the cable modem and the router, leave everything unplugged for 5 minutes, plug in the cable modem and wait until it is fully booted up, plug in this router and walk away for a bit. Give it 5-10 minutes and hopefully you'll be good to go.\n\nThe interface looks a bit dated and clonky but most do. Seems the least priority is given to creating a clean, attractive interface for all these things, but coming from an Airport Extreme where you have essentially no features to work with, this is a dream. The ability to edit the names of the clients is something I was never able to do before and it really makes a difference.\n\nI wanted something with the ability to kick clients off the network while I am using the Quest to ensure it has no bandwidth competition with devices that are not in use at the time the Quest is being used, but then put them back on without having to jump through hoops, re-entering passwords and such. I have a lot of devices on my network and while they may not be in use, they are still hovering around and eating up some bandwidth even while idling.\n\nThis router allows that in an easy peasy way but the icons used are confusing. First, if you go to the Network map, clients section, you will see a list of all the clients on your network. You can click the pencil next to the name of the device and change it to make life easier. On the right side, if you click Block, that client gets blacklisted and cannot connect to the network. If you click View Blacklist, you will see all of the blocked clients and there is a garbage can icon on the right. This is a confusing and poor icon choice because most people would think that this will remove the client entirely. It doesn't. It simply puts the client back on the whitelist. It's a great thing to have, for example:\n\nLet's say you have a Zoom meeting and want to ensure that there's as little connection issues as possible. You can block all other clients on the network that are not needed and have all the bandwidth to yourself for your meeting and when it's over, just click the garbage can on each device in the blacklist and poof! they are all able to connect again.\n\nI am not really understanding the point of the QoS feature on this device because in the past when I've set up QoS in a work environment, you are able to directly allocate bandwidth to devices. Ideally, this would be what you would use if you had a Zoom call rather than kicking clients off for a time. With this router's QoS, you have two choices: On or Off. Each device listed has a Priority switch that is turned on or off. You can turn on the Priority switch for one, some or all devices, but there's nothing else, so you have no idea how bandwidth allocation is implemented here.\n\nUnder the On/Off switch for QoS, there is a bandwidth allocation box for both upload and download with each set at 1000. You can change this number, but again, it doesn't tell you how it will divvy out that bandwidth to the clients. If you only have one device with the Priority turned on, you are left to wonder what that client is getting as opposed to other devices on the network. That's kind of a shame because you can prioritize a device for Always or for a couple of hours. Would seem the perfect set up for a Zoom meeting as you can give Priority to your device for a set amount of time and the router will release that restriction at the end of the hour or two or whatever you chose without you having to interact with the admin page at all. Unfortunately, you cannot enter times: i.e,. Priority from 10 a.m. to noon. You can choose Always, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours.\n\nI'm not sure what people are talking about regarding monthly fees for Parent Controls. I don't have kids, but opened it up and you can add a child's computer as a device, block certain keywords from being searched online and limit the days/times that your child can get online. I didn't see anything about fees or payment for those features.\n\nI have noticed more zip in my Quest 2 since setting up this router and am quite pleased with it so far. I set up a 5ghz network set to AX only for the Quest's exclusive use, a 2.4ghz Guest Network for all the Echos, Kindles, switches for lights, etc., and a 2.4ghz network for laptops, iPads, etc.",

Again, solid connection with my new TP-Link AX1800 for over a month now (since Christmas 2022).\nUpgraded to this new router for my 'legacy' equipment, as such my 12 year-old Dell XPS 17 (L702x) which was connecting anywhere from 12Mbps-144Mbps (sometimes 300Mbps) utilizing an old Apple Airport Extreme 5th Gen router, but now I'm connecting at 867Mbps with the TP-Link! Fast? Yes. Though my current ISP plan only offers 200Mbps so I've got plenty of room to expand.\n\nSpeedtest showed on average 350-370Mbps connection speed in accordance with the Intel 7260ac WiFi card in my Dell XPS 17 so I'm super happy. Others such as my Apple devices are also connected within speeds. I run dual-band setup on the TP-Link so it can allocate whichever band needed automatically by switching both the 2.4 and 5GHz back and forth for best bandwidth and/or least congestion to establish a stable connection. In order to do this you'll need to enable 'Smart Connect' from the TP-Link tether app or browser setup, otherwise you'll only be connecting to one - either 2.4 or 5GHz. I also love how you can monitor every equipment that is connected to your network - complete with name, duration and band/speed. Sometimes I do get switched to the 2.4GHz band with speeds of less than 12Mbps but it usually finds itself switching back to higher speeds fairly quickly - which my Airport Extreme fails to do most of the time unless I do a hard reset.\n\nThat said, this is an exceptional router for the money - it covers dual bands, WiFi 6 capability and the newer WPA3 security feature. Money well spent for many years to come and I do highly recommend the TP-Link.",

When I disabled Smart Connect, I achieved 190Mbps. You can login to the router with HTTP or HTTPS but the latter has to be explicitly enabled and will produce a warning from your browser that the address isn't trusted. This is because TP Link uses a self-signed certificate whose trust can't be verified; if TP Link would've just paid for a certificate from a trust agent (for a very minimal cost), you wouldn't get this warning.

        "content": "I always worry about updating technology because as an older individual, technology isn't my thing. However, after watching videos and looking at reviews I figured surely my husband and I can do this. Just to be safe, though, I asked a former co-worker who worked in my office's IT department to be \"on-call\". So setting the router up with our modem went well, and I downloaded the app on my phone (with my data on) and proceeded to follow the instructions. All went well until the step where I was to get an email to continue with the set up - the email never came. I began to get messages that my server wasn't recognized. So frustrating! I could have called the company's tech support but thought I'm not going to wait on-line and deal with the frustration of set up \"from afar\" - been there and done that. So I called my IT friend who came over and he couldn't understand why my phone couldn't receive an email as he could access the router on his phone. He then proceeded to set up the router without the use of the app. We don't have a lot of technology to deal with but the set up of two phones, a TV, two Alexa devices and a Smart Plug was definitely something I doubt I'd have been able to do without assistance. In hindsight, maybe we just should have rented a router from our cable company - which I'm sure their staff would have installed. At any rate - won't ever go through this again. As for how the router works - we've noticed an improvement in speed, less buffering on our TV, and I'm hoping a higher level of security in general than what our aged router was providing. As I said, like a lot of older people, I'm not a technology guru but can't understand why these things don't set up as easily as a computer or new phone that pretty much set up by themselves with minimal effort on your part.",

        "content": "First, when it was delivered to me I had to cut the plastic things off. Then I was trying to manuever the box to see the best way to cut it and where. To my surprise, I only needed to lift the box up, after taking out the styrafome. Then I unpacked it. The hardest step was taking the sink connection apart and finding out how exactly to connect it to the sink. Several Youtube videos helped me with that. Next step was connecting the water hose to the sink with the adaptor attached to the sink. You push down on the round, white thing while pushing up on the part under it. It is not hard to attach but to attach it correctly is challenging because you have to push up and hold the round, white thing down at the same time. It is not really that difficult but it is not so easy either. It finally cooperated. (Now, the more I connect it, the easier it gets.) I placed the water outlet tube in the sink and turned the water on. At this point, if the sink connection is not good, water will spew a little and/or drip. On the other hand, if it is well connected, it is amazing. The water will NOT come out until you turn the washer on, choose your 2 settings and press start. At that moment the washing machine will amazingly let the water flow from the sink. But at this point, watch where the other end of the hose connects to the washing machine. If it is not tight, it will leak. That has happened to me numerous times. Once the machine starts, just let it to its job. It is impressingly quiet while it works. Beware of where and how you leave the water hose where the water comes out. Twice it has slipped out of the sink and got water all over my floor. But you learn by doing and I now push it further down into the sink and observe the water when the machine starts emptying. It normally takes about 30 minutes to complete its wash cycle and spin. I have now used the machine for about 2 weeks and I AM satisfied!! My apt is small to I have to move the machine from the kitchen, over carpeting, the another room. To facilitate this, I bought a Vestil FWD 1824 3r fiberwood dolly with large wheels on Amazon. Mine came already assembled. It has made a big difference when trying to manuver the washing machine. Yes, the machine does have 2 wheels on the back, which are helpful, but with this dolly, moving it is much easier. Make sure to turn the water in your sink OFF before disconnecting the hose. One last comment: water CAN and does flow uphill! The water leaving the machine must go from the bottom of the washer to the top of my sink, which is a couple of feet. How it defies physics I do not know, Maybe it's some kind of air or water pressure. So, in summary, I am very surprised that the machine can control the water flow in my sink and that water pressure can flow up. I must also say that yesterday for the first time, I cleaned the filter in the tub of the machine. It was rather dirty. Getting it off was easy but getting it back on was difficult only because I had not taken a good look at exactly how the bag with the filter was placed. It took several attempts but I finally got it to snap. Now that I know, the next time will be quite easy. The whole process and everything involved is easy once you get some experience. Like anything else. When you remove the filter at the bottom of the machine, be careful. I think water that did not flow up to the sink collected there, so when I took it off for cleaning, a good but unexpectedly came out. Solution: put a bowl under the black filter before you unscrew it to remove it. So in conclusion, I would definitely recommend this machine. One last word of advise: Read the directions before you start!",

        "content": "Value proposition:\n- I'm a single guy in a 1br apartment in a historical building, so this guy has been a game changer. The alternative was paying $5 in quarters for a small wash and dry at the laundromat across the street. No thanks. Return on Investment (ROI) is strong here. If you're a sporty person like I am and do say two loads per week - one light, one dark, it pays for itself in six months. In my case, it'll be sooner.\n\nSetup:\n- I have this setup semi-permanently in my kitchen near the sink and use the adaptor to hook it up and then detach it after use. I have to take off the aerator on my sink to use the adaptor, so sometimes I just leave the adaptor on the sink for a few days but this makes doing dishes a bit messier. It's not difficult taking the adaptor on and off; if you're busy it's just another thing to have to do. If using the kitchen sink, make sure you don't have a \"shower head\" style head only because it won't work with that I wouldn't think.\n- My only real complaint with the setup is that the drain hose is a little too short to comfortably reach the sink so I ended up using a mini bungee cord to make it reach, hooking the bungee cord around the faucet. You could also get an extra PVC hose to extend the drain hose, it appears to be about 1\" in diameter. For drying, I got a simple metal drying rack from Amazon, whatever the top choice was, and it works well.\n\nFunctionality:\n- This gal works beautifully and cleans my stuff every bit as well as my parents' $1.5k+ machine. It is a top loader but agitates gently like a front loader, so it doesn't damage your stuff like one of those older machines. I use the Kirland Signature pods that come in the orange conatiner with this machine and they work well. I do hope that isn't too much detergent for the machine, which is the .9 version, but so far no side effects.\n-On settings, it's curious that the \"heavy\" load cycle is shorter than the \"normal\" load cycle. Not sure how that happened. I use \"heavy\" because it's already 63 minutes. There are also \"gentle\" and \"rapid\" cycles that are shorter so you have flexibility.\n- Basically, the way clean water works is that you turn on the sink after hooking up the intake hose, and the machine only lets water in when it's needed. To get warm water you just turn both taps on all the way and for cold, you use the cold, just like you normally would with a sink. The manual says to use cold water only but I've used warm water for whites with no side effects. I have yet to try hot only. Just proceed at your discretion realizing if there is damage to the machine it could void the warranty. Honestly, it seems unlikely it would cause damage, it's probably just some legal thing.\n\nWrap-up: That's really it, I'm a happy camper and could not think of a single $250 purchase that I've made that has been a better investment and improvement to quality of life than this beauty. I end up using it pretty much every day because I'm a sporty guy and the load size is small-ish. That said, I can wash everything except for like a duvet in there so it's perfect for one person.",

        "content": "I live in an apartment building with an on-site laundromat. As anyone who's had to use shared laundry facilities knows, it can be a real hassle having to schlep your laundry to the laundry room only to find that all of the machines are in use and/or half are out of service. Not to mention the added expense of paying $2+ per load, per machine. It adds up.\n\nThis little washer has been a godsend. I can conveniently do my laundry in my own home and on my own schedule. No more waiting on people who aren't paying attention to their machine cycles or having to check back in to see if any machines have been freed up. And the added privacy of not having to flash my skivvies in front of people while loading/unloading machines is nice, too.\n\nAnyway, regarding everyday use:\n\nAs per my review title, it's great! Works just like a regular full-size washer except with maybe 1/3 the capacity (guesstimate). One full hamper's worth of laundry can be split up into 2 - 3 loads, depending on what/how much you're throwing in there. BTW, I don't recommend trying to stuff as much laundry as you can into the tub. Being a pulsator-type washer, overfilling it won't make for efficient washing. Also, it doesn't really fit bulky bedding items like duvets, comforters, and heavy quilts. Unfortunately, I still rely on my apartment building's laundry facilities for those. However, it can handle lightweight bedding items like fitted sheets, flat sheets, and pillowcases/shams just fine.\n\nOperation is simple; it only has five wash modes to choose from, three load size options, and limited cycle customization options. Nothing fancy, just the basics needed to get your laundry clean. Check out the product photos that show the control panel to give yourself a better idea. Wash cycles can be as short as 19 minutes, to as long as 68 minutes depending on what you select.\n\nThe spin cycle does an excellent job of removing excess water. It spins up surprisingly fast for such a compact machine and leaves laundry as damp as any regular full-size washer.\n\nNext to the water inlet is a warning label that states not to connect the hose directly to a hot water tap. I do, however, regularly use WARM water and haven't noticed any adverse effect on the machine.\n\nThe lint trap inside the wash drum does a good job of capturing lint, hair, and even shredded paper like forgotten receipts or potentially life-changing lottery tickets. However, if you're concerned that any stray lint might clog up your plumbing, you can always get one of those lint traps that attach to the end of the drain hose.\n\nA few tips:\n\nI recommend getting a small dolly if you need the washer to be mobile for easier storage. Unfortunately, the built-in wheels the machine has don't really make for easy maneuvering. Also, make sure the dolly has locking casters to keep the washer from shimmying away from where you parked it during the spin cycle.\n\nThis washer can be pretty noisy during agitate cycles and definitely during the spin cycles. If you're able to set it up in a room with a door (like a bathroom), do so to spare yourself from the noise.\n\nI attached the included snap coupling adapter to the faucet on my bathroom sink. I also stuck a faucet aerator inside the adapter to keep water from coming out in a splashing torrent when I want to wash my hands or brush my teeth. I used a 2.2gpm laminar flow aerator since the usual 1.5 makes the washer take a long time to fill with water.\n\nLastly, don't go nuts with detergent. As with any washer, frivolously pouring detergent with reckless abandon can gunk up the insides of the machine and cause premature wear on the motor and/or pump AND cause the washer to develop a bad smell. For a machine this size, maybe a tablespoon of detergent - MAX - will do.",

        "content": "Excellent purchase, but you have to be realistic with what the machine can do. I moved to an apt with no in unit laundry, and the shared laundry room on each floor was gross, so needed a solution for doing laundry at home. I love that It’s super easy to set up (maybe 45 seconds to set up each time) and lm able to store this on a mini dolley in a closer out of sight.\n\nThe washer cleans VERY well and is just as good as cleaning as a full sized machine in my experience, though I don’t have experience washing any super dirty/muddy clothes. This is a small washer and I typically do about 3 or 4 mini loads a week and I try not to overfill to avoid issues. I almost always use the “Gentle” setting at the largest load capacity and each cycle is about 33 minutes start to finish, clothes come out pretty well wrung out too so dry quickly in my mini dryer as well. To give an idea of a couple of “load sizes” it can fit:\nA. ~8 tshirts\nB. ~ 2-3 pairs of jeans with a few socks and undies\nC. 2 bath sheet size towels\n\nI’ve had this unit for about a year and haven’t had any problems with leaking or performance issues which is nice.\n\nOne small small annoyance:\n1. After a cycle is done, there seems to be a little extra water stuck in the bottom of the basin. It’s not visible but if you shake the unit you can hear a little water sloshing. Never had an issue with mold or any smells due to this but I do run a vinegar cleaning cycle once a month roughly and store the unit with the lid open to dry out better",

My clothes come out looking and feeling clean, and the spin cycle does a good job. It’s also extremely quiet.\n\nI like the choices of wash cycles and load sizes. My clothes really don’t get dirty (usually!), so the rapid wash will probably meet most of my needs. Eighteen minutes from start to finish!\n\nMy only complaint is it’s not very maneuverable and the wheels don’t work well. It would be helpful if it had a handle on the back to help pull it, and without one, it drags more than rolls. I’m concerned dragging it might damage my floor, so I just pick it up and carry it. It does have two handles on the sides for carrying and it isn’t heavy, so this works well enough.\n\nIf you’re going to use it in an RV, be aware it can fill up your gray water tank fast. I empty mine between each load.\n\nOverall, I’m super happy and can see using this for many years.",

You hook it up to your sink, add a bit of detergent, and it does the rest. It gets even my puppy pads really clean.

I have had it for a bit over a month now and recently purchased the Panda dryer and although I can't put all my clothes into one load it still saves me the hassle of lugging my stuff to the laundromat and spending $15-$30 every week. I have been able to wash all my clothes, jackets, throw blankets, bed sheets, large towels, small towels, even a thin comforter and even my bath mats! I use less soap and since its just me I no longer have to add laundry sanitizer which I did previously because of the shared machines at the laundromat, so there's more savings there! I also was able to purchase the dolly even though I leave the washer in my bathroom next to the tub (because its a rather large bathroom), its nice to be able to move it around when I need to mop underneath or to move it closer to the shower hose and outlet when in use. I keep up with the maintenance of the machine cause I want it to last for a long time so after every use I wipe it down make sure inside of the lid edge is all clean, I unscrew the little filter in the back and drain it and make sure its clean and I clean the inside of the drum lint filter as well as it gets FULL of lint and cat fur. Something else I found really helpful was because the machine is on the dolly it makes it way taller than my sink and tub so I had noticed at first that when I had the drainage tube set up over the tub and draining into the tub it would drain while also filling up and I thought that I got a doozy BUT in order for the drum to fill up you just have to make sure the drainage tube it set where its either higher than the machine or at the same level and not way down below the drum. Once I set it up in the tub that it was higher all was good and the drum was able to fill up properly.\nI did a lot of research before purchasing the machine like water usage, and that it barely uses any electricity and I watched a ton of YouTube video reviews of the same machine to see how they set it up and worked with it and made me more confident in the purchase since it was a bit of a bigger purchase for me. I did the same with the panda dryer and I've been happy with both. If it means not being at a dirty, loud and gross laundromat and I can do laundry in my home no matter how long it takes, I am happy.\nI would 100% recommend this machine, it arrived within 2 days, set up was easy, doesn't take much water and uses a minimal amount of electricity and does like a normal washing machine would do just smaller.",

        "content": "So this is actually a review including 2 bottles, as I recently bought one to replace the first one I had (first pic/blue-pink bottle) and haven't used the new one (Opal) yet. So functionality review will be based around my experience with my first.\n\nFor the sake of those looking for a quick answer; I find the product to be worth the price-point. I also believe in getting what you pay for. I had my bottle for around a year (only tossed-out due to my own folly) and it did everything I wanted out of a bottle.\n\nCons:\n- There was a bit of a weird, chemically smell/taste like others have mentioned. I did get it to go away; cannot say if others could as well.\n- You run a small-risk of getting a pre-dented bottle? Amazon makes it pretty easy to exchange (for me).\n-A little difficult to get the gasket in and out, so you can really make sure you don't have any bacteria growth in your lid.\n- Supposedly \"not actually vacuum-insulated\". **This is based on responses within other comments.\n\nPros:\n- Absolutely keeps your drinks cold. Even if you just put the drink in cold, with no additonal ice.\n- At least sturdy enough to only get a little scuffed-up when it falls to the asphalt from the top of your car and no safety-bands on it.\n- Good for a long time, as long you don't heck up and let it get gross by accident. And you may even just be more confident in your sanitizing abilities than I am.\n\nAs I mentioned above; I got my first bottle (blue/pink) about a year ago. I only replaced it because of my own mess-up, where I left Liquid IV I was drinking-on in it for waayy too long (I am ADHD and object permanency/executive dysfunction is a constant struggle) and I was not going to try and believe I could clean it thoroughly enouch, especially since the bacteria had gotten under the gasket as well (the thin, opaque, silicone-ring in your lid that creates the seal. The ring is removable (need something to pry it out), however that's a tight spot and didn't think I could scrub into it enough and feel safe.\n\nI don't believe my first bottle came with the additional 2-lids, so that was a nice surprise this-time-around, to have some options.\n\nI won't even really touch on the \"is it actually vacuum-insulated or not\" convo because, as much as I have a vague-knowledge about vacuum-spaces and the science to that.. I have the ability to admit I know nothing about how that applies to water-bottles enough to make some of the statements others have in their reviews. The Company seems adamant in that they are.. and if they have a step within their manufacturing process that involves attempting to create some kind of a vacuum-layer? Then I'm not going to sit here and try to call them liars, just because it doesn't seem to fit an ideal of what that should look like. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nDoes it keep your stuff cold?? Yeah, 100%. I have put just refrigerated water, with no ice, and it's stayed cold for hours. Then it's even colder/longer with ice. I did get the weird, chemically smell/taste that others have mentioned. But I just used a straw-cleaning brush to get into the drinking-nozzle and crevices of the lid with some Dawn and really hot water and it was gone.\n\nThere were a few, good drops that had happened and it barely dented, really even barely scuffed, which was impressive.. until.. lol\n\nWe come to the original order of the replacement bottle (Opal). Now, I was able to immediately order a replacement (that is 100% fine) and am sending this one back.. however, I am just incredibly curious what in the WORLD happened to it, more than anything?? Lol My old-bottle had never exactly fallen at 50mph onto a curb or anything like that.... But if the bottle in the 2nd pic is any indication to the possible results, I don't recommend being that rough with it. Lol the Amazon bag did not have any damage that correlated to the damage on the box/bottle, so I'm assuming it had already happened before being packaged for shipping to me. With how hard Amazon employees work, I don't really blame them for missing it (or not caring if they did see it lol).\n\nIf you're looking for a water-bottle that functions and you don't mind the possibility of needing to exchange a faulty one and giving it a GOOD scrub before-use (really should be, anyways)? This is a great choice at a more humble price-point, compared to other brands whose products don't function much, if any better than this one would for you.",

        "content": "I purchased the 64oz bottle to replace my TAL Hydration version of the same size.\n\nI realize it seems a bit excessive to get a 64oz bottle but personally I disagree. I know I'm hydrated if that bottle is empty at the end of the day. The best part is if I put a little ice in there, the water is gonna be cold for a long time.\n\nIn terms of the Iron Flask version it's really got everything I need. 3 different lids to choose from. I usually use the flip top one which is much easier to clean than the screw cap I was using previously. The black/white gradient design is pretty sick as well. Honestly the best part so far has been the customer service. I tried to order a replacement cap for my TAL bottle and waited....and waited. No response, so eventually I cancelled the order and went with Iron Flask. I didn't realize it came with a lifetime warranty until I received it. Messaged support to register my bottle and it was all done within the hour.\n\nI may come back to this review in the future as I've only had the bottle a couple weeks but so far so good.",

I am very happy with I pour cold water in it and its cold even after a couple hours or overnight. i always keep water with me and i wanted a 64 oz as i had in the past to avoid refills. Only thing I would find difficult is that I am used to a handle on the side of the plastic bottles, so along the purchase I bought the iron flask water bottle sleeve made for the 64oz, which has a handle on the side and bonus a shoulder strap to be hands free. Water in the plastic bottle would get to room temp but not this one. i love icy cold water and it stays like that until its empty. I researched a couple vacuum insulated 64 oz bottles and i decided to go with this one and with a week of using it i am happy with it.",

        "content": "I have been using a couple of Contigo water bottles for the past few years (a 24 oz. and 32 oz. Ashland Autospout), and I really liked them. However, they are not insulated, so will collect condensation on them when filled with ice water. I decided to get the Iron Flask because I know somebody who has one and likes it. I purchased the 40 oz. black bottle.\n\nI can fill this bottle with ice and cover the ice in water, and the ice will still be there 8-9 hours later, but only if you're not drinking out of it (I left ice water in it over night just as a test). If you are drinking from it occasionally, the ice is more likely to melt a little faster. Condensation has never formed on the outside of the bottle. The wide mouth is pretty much par-for-the-course for metal bottles; my Contigo tops actually fit well on this bottle. My MSR MiniWorks EX is a little more of a snug fit, but it still fits enough that I feel confident that I could use the two in concert to procure water outdoors. I have also purchased the Iron Flask paracord handle, which makes the bottle easier to carry. I do see some room for improvement, though not with the bottle itself, which has been working out great so far. My complaints are mostly with the straw/spout lid (which is the only one I use), and most of those I only really have because I am comparing it to my Contigo lids.\n\nThe old Contigo Autospout lids were better in almost every respect; they had a lower profile, they were more watertight, they had a more rigid straw, and you could operate them with one hand. The Iron Flask lid often has to be set on a surface to be opened with one hand. Having a springy spout with a button-operated catch is a much easier and more convenient system to use one-handed. The loop on the spout lid is also just about perpendicular to the long axis of the bottle, which makes carrying it in hand or attaching it to a backpack a little more cumbersome than a design with an more steeply angled loop. As mentioned above, I purchased the paracord handle, and that makes this bottle significantly more convenient. The air inlet on the lid is plugged by a small post that is molded into the drinking spout. This is enough to keep water from pouring out when the spout is closed, but if the bottle is laid on its side, there will be some minor seeping over time. Something like an umbrella valve might make this problem go away. The last problem I have is the straw is not quite as rigidly fixed to the top as I'd like. If you fill up the bottle with ice, it is harder to jam the straw all the way to the bottom because it is held to the lid with a flexible fitting (looks like silicone, maybe). The Contigo straw was less likely to wobble around as you pushed it through the ice, which meant it was easier to put on when the bottle was filled with ice.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the bottle is very good, but the tops are a little lacking. I would simply use the tops to my old Contigo bottles if they had longer straws that went all the way to the bottom of the bottle, but they don't. Iron Flask should seriously consider creating something similar to the old Autospout lids (or even just licensing the design or something). Even if they sold it separately, I think it would be an excellent addition to a very good bottle.",

        "content": "I have owned LOTS of vacuum insulated stainless steel bottles and this is definitely my favorite. In fact, I own two iron flasks, one in the 64oz size that I keep in my fridge at home and this one, that I take with me on the go (since the 64 oz one is just too big to tote around). I love the lid options (the straw lid is my current favorite but it's nice to be able to shake it up sometimes). I love the color. I love the quality! I bought the silicone boot to go on the bottom which I would definitely recommend. Also, this does a good job of keep beverages cold, but I find the perfect combination is this bottle plus 3-4 reusable silicone ice cubes. My water stays ICE ICE cold all day long!\n\nI have zero complaints about this bottle and highly recommend this brand if you're in the market.\n\nI sincerely hope this review has been helpful to someone else! And yes, I paid full price for both of them. Feel free to ask any questions!",

Customer service was helpful in getting that situation resolved quickly and without hassle. All things considered pretty good experience overall with the product and iron flask as a company, would recommend.\n\nFor the bottle itself, it keeps drinks the same temperature they were put in for quite a while, poured hot water in at night when it was too hot to drink comfortably and then next morning it was a pleasant level of hot. From what I noticed the outer part of the bottle doesnt change temperature due to the drink inside.\n\nLids, they all work though personal preference plays a big part in which you like best. Screw on lid is great for keeping drink temperature the same for longer but isnt great for frequent quick sips. Flip top is good but drinking from the bottle may be difficult for people with larger noses or larger bottle sizes due to the weight and since the hole is so recessed in the lid. Straw lid is convenient with ease of use and cleaning (inner section is removable and comes with a spare), solid top section doesnt feel the best since its rectangular shaped but you get used to it",

        "content": "This water bottle has been great in so many ways. I bought it while pregnant because I knew I’d need an easy way to drink tons of water while breastfeeding and caring for a new baby. Boy was I right! Used it in labor/delivery, all day especially those first few weeks when it was hard to get up and down to get a cup of water, all night when baby woke up to nurse and triggered me to be thirsty, and it was the first water bottle the baby learned to drink from when old enough for water. We always have it on us when we leave the house. We farm and garden and have used it daily on farm trips and it holds up to getting dropped, extreme heat, bitter cold, dirt, sand, cow poop, you name it. The colored powder coating and the rest of the water bottle still looks fantastic.\n\nEventually the straw lid, that I love so much because it allows me to drink a lot of water quickly, started having suction issues, leaking, and eventually the mouthpiece became loose from me fiddling with it trying to get it to work and from cleaning and the kid lost it somewhere after that. Switched to the canteen style lid and didn’t like it.\n\nI decided to reach out to Iron Flask to see if they would replace the straw lid and they were super fast to respond to my email and sent me not one, but TWO replacement straw lids (for free). It came with 2 of the actual lids, 4 straws, and 2 straw cleaning brushes! Retail packaging and everything. Very impressive customer service.\n\nMy only regret with this water bottle was not buying a second one in 40oz and having that one for daytime and the 32oz one that stays clean by the bedside for night time so if I’m tired and the daytime one is dirty I don’t take a dirt covered water bottle into the bedroom. Maybe that’ll be my next gift to myself.\n\nMy husband has the biggest sized one for work and loves it too. So glad to not be buying him packs of water from the store anymore. Not we spend less, drink less micro plastics and fluoride, and have nice cold water on hand in abundance. I’ve noticed his water consumption has gone way up since he got his and he usually drinks the entire thing during his workday.\n\nHighly recommend this product and company.",

I did not read the size on them, which I why they're smaller than I assumed (as I thought all or most coasters would be the same size, but that's on me). I use 2 in between the seats and the other 2 on my car doors, driver and passenger side. They are easy to install and easy to remove. Have not had to remove them for cleaning yet, but it seems like they would be easy to clean.

        "content": "I have 6 pairs of binoculars including 10x42 and 12x42. The vortex set I got was the 8x42. I’m a bow hunter so I’m always looking for that great set of binoculars. This vortex set is a little heavier than my others. And by the way the other sets I have are off brand and range in prices from 30 bucks up to 130 bucks. The first thing I noticed was the quality of the build and they way they fit my hands. They are just more comfortable compared to my other sets. What I did like about these was the bino harness that is included. I’ve already got a vortex bino harness and they usually cost right around 25-30 bucks. There was a neck strap that is really nice along with a lens cloth and lens caps. There is a cover that can be taken off on the back side of the focus wheel so that you can use these with a tripod. Now this is the part most won’t like. The quality of the optics and magnification. When I look through these binoculars and then my others I really don’t see much of a difference. The image is clear. When I go back and forth between this pair and my other binos I honestly can’t really tell a difference besides the feel in my hands. Now I’ve been told this by a lot of people but me being me I had to know first hand. They was right. One bonus with these vs other brands though is the warranty. There’s a lifetime warranty on vortex. So in all your pretty much paying for the name and warranty. Like I said I’ve always been told there’s not much of a difference up until you start paying those high prices but right now I’m just hunting whitetail and turkey so I don’t need something extravagant. Although maybe one day I can. Until then I’m completely happy with my vortex optics.",

        "content": "First impressions:\nPurchased the Vortex Optics Crossfire HD Binoculars, 10x42 version.\n\nI bought these binoculars for bird watching, which has specific requirements as opposed to sports events and nature hikes. I wanted a large enough magnification that I could easily see the birds, but also with a wide enough field of view so that when a bird hops from one branch to another – something they are prone to do – that they wouldn’t be lost out of frame. I also wanted a fairly light weight and sturdy construction, all of which I found in my choice.\n\nThese binoculars provide a crisp, clear image with no refraction. That is no colored fringes near the outer edges. The aperture is large enough that there is plenty of light gathering ability. Focusing is easy and natural, with the dial centrally located.\n\nThis line is advertised as light weight, and it is, compared to other brands, but still it’s noticeable when hanging around your neck. This is not a complaint.\n\nCHOOSING MAGNIFICATION:\nFor my whole life I’ve chosen and used bargain basement binoculars, usually 8X magnification. I thought 10X would be marginally better, but experts claim that when you use anything over 8 times, then the image can bounce around from your hand movements and shaking. I didn’t choose the 12X for that reason. The 10X that I purchased has noticeable jitters if held with one hand, but not so much that you lose track of the image. I’m glad I didn’t get the 12X. I’m quite pleased with the 10X, but I think I’d be just as happy with the 8X.\n\nCHOOSING FIELD OF VIEW:\nAs mentioned above, I want the objective lens diameter to be large enough so that if a bird is on the move it would be easy to track and not fly out of range. The 42mm turns out to be perfectly suited to my needs. The next step up, 50mm may have made the binoculars bulkier and heavier, so I’m happy with this choice.\n\nADJUSTMENTS:\nThe inter-pupil distance adjustment was easy and intuitive. If the left and right sides are not adjusted to your eyes, you will see dark edges on the sides of the image. Once adjusted you don’t have to worry about this, unless you accidentally jar the adjustment.\nThe diopter adjustment, likewise, was simple and intuitive. Once set up (if one of your eyes is weaker than the other) you can set once and forget about it.\n\nThe neck strap was easy to install and adjust. No problems there.\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the body strap for the carry bag it just too complicated. It reminds me of a medieval torture device. I discarded it and purchased a simple shoulder strap.\n\nMINOR COMPLAINT:\nI found that to see clearly through the binoculars and get a full field of view, your eye must be positioned exactly in the center of the eyepiece and at a specific distance from your eyeball. For me, this required me to hold the eyepiece about 3/8 inches from my eye. I found that resting my forefinger on my forehead, and the binocular eyepiece on the edge of my finger accomplished this nicely. The problem, however requires a more comfortable and reliable solution.\n\nI purchased a pair of 42mm rubber eye cushions that did the trick. That size rubber buffer is standard for microscopes, and are available for about $10 on the internet. See photos.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAll-in-all, I quite satisfied with this excellent product. It has made my bird-watching experience much more productive and enjoyable.",

For amateur birders, these are really nice. The sharpness of the viewing is pretty amazing and they are much stronger than any pocket-size binoculars. The price was also $100 less than we saw elsewhere. Overall we are very happy with them. Slight larger that we would like for hiking but the trade-off for a better image and longer viewing distance is worth it.",

        "content": "So far I'm very pleased with this product. I think that the few negative comments have been made by people who don't understand the science of sampling and data collection. They don't realize that with any device used for measurements, there will always be a sampling error. They think if the device doesn't record the same result every time then there's a problem with the machine. Yes, you can place the probe into soil at different locations in the same pot or garden area and it may record slightly different readings, say maybe 6 at one spot and 6.5 at another. But for the price of this device, it is very accurate. Also, many comments were made that they inserted the probe into a glass of water and it didn't read \"wet\", when the instructions clearly say not to do this. There were comments made about the probe being a weak spot in the device, and would break off. Yeah.... If you try to use this as a pick axe or a fence post. You're not supposed to beat it into the ground with a sledge hammer. It is a delicate instrument and should be treated as such. Some people, in their reviews, imply that they stick the probe into the soil and leave it there as a permanent fixture, which you can't do. If you treat this instrument with respect, gently insert it into the soil (without a hammer please) and then wipe off the steel probe with a cloth or even your hand, it seems to work perfectly. And, as the directions state, don't insert it into a cup of water to test it. If you want to test it for accuracy, insert the probe into a bundle of dry peat moss or potting soil, take the recording, and then add various amounts of water to the soil and retest. Record the results you get and then you will have a guide as to what it means when the probe registers say, \"5 - moderate moisture\", or \"9 - very wet\", or \"2 - very dry\". I think this is a great little instrument and an excellent value, and comes with a warranty. I just received an email from the company reminding me that it has an 18 month warranty and to contact them if I have any issues. I am a professional Mechanical Engineer as well as a practicing physician, with a hobby growing some exotic plants. I think this is a great little instrument, with good accuracy, and not any more delicate than I would expect. The price is great on Amazon, with free delivery, good communication from the seller and with a good warranty. Definitely would recommend to my friends and buy again.",

        "content": "I purchased this moisture meter in the latter half of last year to use for my Calathea, Alocasia, and Variegated Aroids that require more diligent watering routines. In my experience, it works great for soil mixtures that are made up of smaller particles (sand, peat moss, store-bought potting mix) BUT it does not give an accurate reading for mixes that are more chunky or loose (I use a homemade aroid mixture with pine bark, perlite, coco coir, charcoal, and worm castings). Overall it is a good product that I’ve found good use with for my ficus, peperomia, pothos, etc. even though it does not work for the specific plants I purchased it for. I’d recommend this product for the more casual plant parent that uses denser substrate, but I would not recommend for someone that uses looser/customized potting mixes with more aeration.\n\nAttached photos are of the meter in my custom mix vs store bought mix of two plants watered at the same time about 2 days ago! :)",

I can't tell exactly just how accurate it is (as I have nothing else to compare it to) but because I'm notoriously an 'over-waterer' - just the fact that I'm thinking about watering...enough to take the time to use the meter...it makes me think twice about giving my plants another drink. I've done a bit of online research to find out about each of my plants' watering needs, so I've got a good idea now about who-needs-what, and when. So far so good - and right now, I'm going to give the water/moisture meter most all the credit. I really believe my plants will continue to be healthy, and my thumb will get greener every step of the way. It's a good product in my book! -jjk",

We checked all connections, replaced the battery in the remote, ordered yet another new remote, and still the lights don’t work. I reached out to the company and am waiting to see if they have any suggestions. In the meantime I have ordered the newer version of the lights.

The remote control for the lights work awesome and the Bluetooth feature where you can use your phone as the remote works good too and it was really easy to sync up. All in all I was very happy with these lights and my overall purchase. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is your unable to attach the lights one after the other to best use all of your lights you have to start all the way at the beginning where your converter box is and meet up in the middle where last left off if you are trying to cover your whole room if that makes any sense and also could be factor for some people.

The ease of convenience without the need for power helps ensure your newborn or child has a clear nasal passage and prevents buildup and drainage into the throat. It would be nice if this came with a pedal or a compression tool but honestly you only have to suck the moisture and drainage out of the nasal passageway. You are protected by the filter so you don't get any throwback into your mouth or throat. Just wash the tubing with hot water and gentle soap (a little goes a long way) and you are good to go for another cleaning. Works well and doesn't need to go a great distance. I recommend purchasing additional filters with it.",

        "content": "Play Video\n This review covers the original Alpha Grillers Instant Read Meat Thermometer I purchased in February of 2017--and the new upgraded model you see here (June 2020 anyway). The original thermometer was purchased for $15 based on users reviews on Amazon. You can't find images of it here anymore (although you can see it in my picture comparing the 2017 model to the 2020 model), but it worked well enough and I've been mostly happy with it for the last three years. Recently it went from unreliably turning on, to not turning without removing the AAA battery and futzing with it (no corrosion) for 10 minutes. I was disappointed but $15 for three years of service and left out in the elements, I can't complain too much. I started to browse for a replacement and see that Alpha Grillers' has a \"lifetime warranty\" so I email them pictures of the unit, invoice info, etc. I kid you not: two days later, a replacement arrives from Amazon, and it's the latest version. So none of that \"pay for shipping\" the\ndead unit back to them, and we'll see what we can do run around. This alone, should convince you that it's worth buying this thermometer since we all know most of the hardware on Amazon is sourced from a giant factory making and selling units to other resellers. It's probably not a question of the difference in the label--it's a difference in the customer support and there, Alpha Grillers gets 5-stars.\n\nAccuracy and response\nSince I have the new unit, I wanted to see how accurate it was so I compared it to my Fluke 52 thermocouple thermometer with a Fluke 80PK-2A immersion probe that I had calibrated with a GE Druck DPI-822. I then filled a narrow mouth Pyrex 1,000ml flask with water from our hot water pot that had been set to 208 F and tried to hold both probe tips near each other in the hot water while trying to take a picture with the hand on a phone. The Fluke 52 and 80PK-2A read out at 184.4 while the Alpha Grillers displayed 184.1. As you know, water cools off fast and it's you don't uniform temperature in the container so the 0.3 degree difference could be the actual temperature difference from the probe positions in the hot water or even the probe shaft differences. Basically, the accuracy is excellent for a $20 meat thermometer.\n\nI also wanted to see how fast the Alpha Grillers unit responds so I filled a second small glass container with ice and water and recorded the display as it was dunked from the ice water back into the hot water (which had now cooled off further). You can watch the video above (it goes from removal from ice bath to hot water, and then back to ice bath and again back to the hot water) but it does respond extremely fast but not necessarily \"instant.\" To be fair, \"instant\" is more of a marketing term and open to interpretation anyway. \"Instant\" coffee still takes time to add to water and stir for example.\n\nI'd say it takes about 3.5 seconds to respond to the ice bath to hot water--which is \"instant\" for most of us. For example, the Fluke 80PK-2A is far slower by design because it's a non-tapered, thicker, stainless immersion probe that absorbs a lot of the heat and can take a lot more abuse. The more slender tapered Alpha Grillers tapered tip is designed to pierce meat and also responds far quicker since you don't have to heat up a lot of metal.\n\nAs far as the design of the unit, like the previous model, it features a hidden magnet to let you stick it to side of your grill which is a great feature, and the hole lets you hang it from a hook as well if your grill's hooks are large enough. The package also comes with four small hook and loop (Velcro) with adhesive on the back if you want to Velcro it to something.\n\nThe new model's rubber buttons are also far easier to press than the previous design's plastic bubble-type. New to this model is very even white LED backlighting. Yes, it looks blue in the official marketing pictures but that's the digital camera color temperature at work--it's actually white.\n\nHold function\nAlso new is a hold, and min max function. The function is unlike most typical thermometers which typically cycle from room temperature to max temp and min temp. It's pretty thought out here for a meat thermometer. On the older model which doesn't have the old function, I would stick the thermometer in to the meat on the grill and twist my head over to see the current temp. On meat on the rear of the grill this means getting your head into odd angles and also pretty close to the grill.\n\nWith the new model, you insert the probe, press the Hold button to activate the hold (it will display HOLD) and read the temp without all the head craning and heat on your face. Press Hold to release the hold function.\n\nOne thing I want to point out: the UI for the hold function might be a little confusing because the hold function first requires that you turn on the hold function before you can use it. This occurs from off state to on. So like most, if you have it folded shut, and open to use, you will have to press the Hold button to turn on the mode. That means the first time you want to use it, you'll have to press it twice: Once to activate the hold mode, and once again to do the first hold. After its in its hold mode, it operates the way you expect it to: Into meat, Hold button to read, and Hold button to release. It doesn't turn off until the thermometer is switched off.\n\nMax Min Function\nThe same Hold button also activates a max and min temp. This again is unlike the typical user interface of a temperature gauge with room temp / max / min cycle with a single click. To read the maximum temperature, you press and hold the Hold button for 3 seconds and it will display the maximum temperature with MAX in the display. Press again and will see the minimum recorded temperature since the unit was on and MIN in the display. One more press and you exit back into the standard mode. Note: you CANNOT the Max/Min function if it is currently in HOLD. You have to do this from the normal operations. Undocumented feature: Alpha Grillers' documentation say to clear the recorded max/min by turning the unit off (folding the thermometer shut) but if you are in the MAX or MIN mode, you can simply press and hold the Hold button for three seconds and it will reset both recorded max and min memories.\n\nCalibration Mode\nUnlike the 2017 mode, the 2020 version features a calibrate feature. On the button that lets you switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, pressing the button for 5 seconds will let you calibrate the unit. The instructions say to put the probe into a container of ice and water by using the Cal (f/c) button or the Hold button to set the calibration point to 32 degrees F or 0 degrees C. Obviously out of the box accuracy is excellent and for meat grilling do you really need this kind of accuracy or to even calibrate? I dunno. I was more afraid of accidentally pressing the calibrate button and throwing it out of whack so I went ahead and pressed the Cal button for 5 seconds which causes the display to show \"CALL\" (yes there's only one L in calibrate) but rather then letting me accidentally mess up the calibration, the thermometer displayed \"ERR\" and then went back into normal operation. My guess is the unit won't even let you calibrate it unless it's in an ice bath first so my worries about screwing up the calibration are pretty unlikely since you'd have to accidentally dunk it into an ice bath first.\n\nBuild quality and battery\nUnlike the original Alpha Grillers I had which runs off of AAA, the new unit uses (which comes pre-installed) a CR2032 coin cell. I think this is an improvement as AAA kinda stink. They seem to be the most prone to leaking of all the cylinder cells I use (looking at you Kirkland). Lithium coin-cells, though more expsnsive, are more reliable, far less likely to leak (and ruin your unit) and operate at lower temperatures. The higher voltage also means more power for the the advanced functions in the unit too. I can't say anything about battery life as I haven't had the unit long enough, but I'm sure the LED backlight is the largest consumer of power so if you use it sparingly, it'll probably last quite a while.\n\nWater resistance\nAlpha Grillers calls it \"water proof\" and in the documentation, it's stated that you can \"fully submerge\" it in water for a short-time so long as the battery compartment is screwed on tightly. I didn't dunk my unit but I have no reason to doubt the water resistance of it. There are no visible screws anywhere on the unit and there is a gasket in the battery compartment (the gasket could be a little larger though to increase the seal as there are no ridges to mate with the gasket on the actual battery cover, just a flat surface). The only ingress of water would likely come through the gasket flattening over time or through the pivot point of the probe.\n\nThe previous 2017 model used a small nub switch that the temperature probe boom depresses to switch off or on. This switch has moved to the inside of the unit which also adds to its water resistance. The probe boom itself is very stiff to open and close which also adds to water resistance. I have no idea how the probe is connected to actual controller board inside or how water resistant that is. The 2020 unit actually switches off at about a 45 degrees angle too which is an improvement over the 2017 model which required closing it firmly to switch off. I would often not switch off if you didn't close it correctly.\n\nI think this is plenty of water and dirt resistance for a meat thermometer unless you're a Navy Seal Griller who needs to scuba up from a sub before grilling on the beach. The main take away is you can probably leave this on your grill during inclement weather without worrying about it being killed. The previous model I had did not have any weather resistance claims and also no gasket in the battery compartment which might be how I killed it.\n\nImprovements\nComing from the previous model, it's a big improvement but it's not without complaints. I think the Hold feature is great, but the button is too close to the temperature scale and backlight button. This means you have to angle your thumb to hit it straight on. You're also going to almost always hit that button from an angle which will put more stress on it over time. The other complaint is the hold button should be activated from power on without having to press it once. I suppose this is done to prevent someone from reading the wrong temperature but I'd rather have it on.\n\nOverall the 2020 model is a big improvement over the 2017 model. Currently it's quite a bit more expensive ($15 for 2017 model vs $20 for 2020 model) but I think the improvements are worth it. And let me again point out the customer service Alpha Grillers provides. My old one let go three and half years later and they stood behind it. For a $15 thermometer. Even if they didn't and they said, \"it's been three years bud,\" I'd buy another one with the improvements, accuracy and speed the new model has over the old one.\n\nAnd yes, I received this unit free, because my old unit died. Alpha Grillers sent it to me as a warranty replacement not to have it reviewed. It did not ask me to write my review, I did it because a company that stands behind its products deserves recognition and is worthy of my time spent.",

They're starting to look worn and I need to replace them with the same size but with all-around elastic to keep the edges from popping off after many seatings. This bottom sheet is PERFECT as the extra elastic keeps it in place and corners stay put and the fabric is soft for our 2 legged family members. Also, I remove it once or twice a day to shake the dog hair off outside and the hairs just float away and don't stick. I use the quick wash setting on warm in my washer and dry on low and it comes out like new. The deep pocket allowance probably helps too at keeping the sheet on the couch. Will be buying more.

I’ve only had them for about 4 years but they have holes in them and they’re not doing the job anymore. So I bought these new dark gray dish cloths to replace them. They are soft but sturdy. I currently live in PA and I’ve never experienced the kind of hard water they have up here. The water is so hard, my wash cloths can stand on their own when they air dry. But these dish cloths remain soft and they are easy to use. They are not overly large but they are definitely larger than my hand. When I reach for them I hesitate because the quality is so good I feel like I shouldn’t be using them to wash dishes. They are very absorbent and the waffle design makes cleaning a breeze. They are great as a gift also. I’ll be getting a set for my sister’s house warming and I’ll be getting more in different colors for myself to replace all my others.",

        "content": "Kids find this game fun and interesting, and it's not super tedious for adults either. There's a bit of a learning curve for some kids, because it's a lot to remember at first. But you can teach the game in layers: first the primary rule set (taco, cat, goat, etc. spoken in rhythm as cards are placed), keeping the specialty cards (gorilla, narwhal, etc.) out of the deck at first. Then when they grasp the basic rules, you can start adding in the other cards to keep it fresh.\nFor parents that have been forced to play CandyLand or Yahtzee Jr. a thousand times, this will be a refreshing change of pace. And it's small enough to keep in a purse or backpack, so it travels much better than your average board game. Unfortunately this packaging doesn't travel very well. It's a slip box instead of having a lid, so it's more likely to tear. The cards require a little bit of jimmying to fit in all the way, which is bad for the longevity of the cards and the box. You CAN purchase this game with a proper lidded box or tin...I recommend that one, if you're able to get your hands on it.",

        "content": "I was very surprised when I found this product, which includes the cable for only $30. Originally, I was just looking to replace my factory Apple charging block for my MacBook Pro, and was fully prepared to spend $70 on the block, and up to another $20-30 on the cable. In fact, I went to Best Buy, looking to do just that - but they no longer sold the original Apple product. So, instead, I spent $70 on some off-brand which I didn’t like, for multiple reasons..\n\nFirst of all, if I’m going to spend that much money, I’m buying the original Apple product; it’s as simple as that. So, I bought the damn thing temporarily, just to have something to use until I could order the Apple one; which, in fact, I was searching for here on Amazon, and surprisingly did not find. That’s how I found this product, instead.\n\nNow, I’m a bit of a review snob. If a product isn’t 4.5+ stars, with a credible amount of reviews, I’m probably not buying it. But, even at this price point, this product was holding a full five stars - so I settled on trying it, instead of going directly to Apple. I love it, honestly. I don’t have any REAL complaints. Just one tiny little thing, that doesn’t really matter. Especially at the end of the day, for this price.\n\nThe one that I returned to Best Buy drove me INSANE, because the damn thing was so heavy that it sagged from every outlet you plugged it into. It didn’t feel ANYTHING like the original Apple charger, and it CONSTANTLY fell out of the socket and interrupted my usage experience. Oh, man I cannot tell you how annoying that was.. and I forget why, now but there was something else about the cable, too that just felt nothing like the one I had been using for the last five years. I just, hated it. All around.\n\nThis bundle, though is almost exactly the same size as the Apple one, and even a smidge smaller, I think, which is nice. It’s light, as it should be and it actually stays plugged in. That was a pleasant surprise, because at this point I wasn’t sure what to expect. I have no complaints whatsoever about the charging block (which is the expensive part, obviously). I have no use for about half of the power of this thing, since my device only uses a maximum of just over 60 watts, so I can’t attest to an increase in charging speed, or anything like that. But, as a replacement for the factory original device, for even less than half the price, I can say that I am surprisingly pleased.\n\nOne of the great things about USB-C and Power Delivery, is that overkill is no problem. It’s not like there’s any worry of pulling too much power, and damaging your device. So, for the fact that this product successfully works as a replacement for my Apple charger, AND includes a free upgrade to upgrade-proof, especially at this price point, is just a really nice added bonus.\n\nThe only complaint that I have, is with the cable. It is decently annoying, but it doesn’t bother me because the product overall is such a great value. When plugged in to my MacBook Pro, it will (pretty often, actually) slip out of the USB-C port, justtt enough to disconnect from the device and stop charging. I have to gently snug it back in there, and it only moves this tiny little indeterminate amount. You would never be able to tell, by just looking at it that the connector isn’t fully seated in place, but when you slide it back in, you can feel it move a teeny bit, and you can feel it kind of snap back into place. Again, moderately annoying, but I don’t particularly find this to be a bother, considering I was perfectly willing and prepared to spend 2-3 times the amount of this product on the genuine Apple version. For the value? I really can’t complain.\n\nPlus, if I ever decide that it indeed IS a bother, I could always buy another cable for $20 or less. Hell, I could even buy one straight from Apple, and I’m STILL saving money. So, again, I really can’t complain. For the manufacturer, though: I would definitely recommend replacing the cable that you offer, with this bundle to eliminate this issue. Cables are cheap, and even if you have to raise the price on this bundle accordingly (what, $1.00? $1.50?), it’s worth it to do so. I mean, come on; the charging block itself is a great value, at this price. The cable is just a bonus, anyway.",

Yes, it looks like a knockoff Apple charger because it basically is. But it works great (I tested it on 3 different laptops and an iPad Pro) and it’s a fraction of the price of buying an OEM Apple charger.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. It feels lighter than a typical OEM Apple charger, but I’m assuming that’s because this one is using GaN technology instead of silicon. I don’t think this is specified one way or the other on the product page though.\n\n2. The included USB-C PD cable is a very nice touch. Usually, you have to buy the cable separately. I was also pleasantly surprised by the included cable’s overall quality. It’s not a braided cable, but it feels well made.\n\n3. The charger is detected by macOS properly as a 118W PD charger.",

        "content": "The Chom Chom was love at first try. I have 4 cats and cat hair is a huge problem. Even though I vacuum regularly, it's the bedding, blankets, throw pillows, and furniture that I have a hard time with and that is where it gets all over my clothes. I hoist the vacuum up to do the upholstery but a vacuum doesn't work on throw pillows and blankets/bedding. And hoisting the vacuum up is laborious and difficult and I'm not going to get the vacuum out to do just that. I have a hand-held cordless vacuum but that doesn't do any good on the furniture etc. Even when I vacuum the furniture it still leaves finite hairs.\n\nSo the Chom Chom was the missing piece to my fur containment puzzle, and now I have the secret weapon needed to finally battle the fur and win! Plus, the Chom Chom is just fun to use. I do agree with one reviewer that the release button is easily accidentally triggered but I just have to be mindful to not press that spot and it's fine. It's easy to use, doesn't snag fibers (there's nothing on it that would snag), it's so easy to remove the fur from the chamber!\n\nThe first time I used it I was literally gasping in amazement at how easy and effective it is. And I bought this, I wasn't gifted it for a review. I did a bunch of research out of desperation, bought 4 different tools (one of them was a scraper kind of tool which totally snags fibers and ruins fabric, the Chom Chom is not like that).\n\nI saw cheaper versions of the Chom Chom with very few reviews, but I chose the Chom Chom and I'm glad I did.\n\nAlso, it's great on clothing so this may replace my sticky tape rollers (which are effective, but I go through the papers quickly and it's hard to peel sometimes).\n\nGive the Chom Chom a try, you won't regret it.",

It pulled up every single hair out of the back of my couches where the cat sits. I couldn’t believe it did such an amazing job. I’ve tried vacuum attachments and tape rollers specifically made for pet hair that didn’t do as great a job as this thing. The key to it is the 2 rubber arms that extend the length of it. They pull the hair up so the bar can grab it and push it into the reservoir. Bottom line- I am not returning it. It’s fantastic! It even worked on my throw pillows, which have little tassels at the end. It can pull the hair out of the tassels too! I love it!!!",

I got this in the mail today and tried it out and I only had to roll over the sofa cushions a couple of times before this thing picked up all of the hair.

        "content": " Honestly, every pet owner should purchase this. I was nervous to purchase this at first, because to be honest, it looks like a tacky cheap item and it's actually not!\nThe amount of lint rollers I go through is unreal, and this thing really does get the job done. Now I don't typically use this for clothing that I'm wearing, but I have before it worked very well!\n\nI typically use this for my couches & blankets and bed sheets, and I'm always amazed at how well it works. You use this in quick back and forth motions and it does pick up so much pet hair in seconds! I love to do this in my guest bedrooms as the last thing before my guests arrive.\n\nPros: Super easy to use. Works great on blankets or bedding, couches, car seats, even my sweaters! The overall quality of the Chom Chom seems great and not cheap. I sometimes use a bit of force when moving the chom chom in the back and forth motion, and I'm not worried I'm going to break or snap the thing. It is something that I would keep in my home and not in my work purse like a typical lint roller. It's super easy to empty and clean out.\nI think this works best on flat surfaces.\nIt does pick up link, tissue remnants and anything trapped that the dryer didn't get very well.\nI haven't had to clean the brush surface much; it stays pretty clean from simply emptying the compartment. It can easily be cleaned with a soft towel soaked with water. Chom chom recommends replacing the gadget over time, I'm not sure when that would be, but I've had mine for over a year, and I don't feel the need to replace it anytime soon - and that's after daily use.\nDoesn't damage my furniture or blankets. Neve snags on anything as well.\nComes ready to use, and no assembly needed.\nSo easy to use, it's handy to have on every floor!\n\nCons: It does tend to work best on tight areas. For example, if my blanket was on my bed, I would tend to pull the blanket tightly before using. I found it easier to pick up the dog hair this way.\nIf your duvet or blanket has texture to it, I found it somewhat difficult to use on.\nI sometimes hit the button that opens the compartment where the fur is collected, but it's so easy to re-shut, this didn't bother me too much.\nI would recommend not using this on curved or lose fabric, as this seems to work better on flat, tight furniture.\nIt's not quiet when using, so I wouldn't recommend using if you're trying to stay quiet while cleaning!\n\nCon & Pro: you do need to empty the compartment every time (or at least I do with two dogs) but that isn't such a bad thing, because it shows the chom chom is doing its job well!\n\nOverall, great purchase and don't regret at all. I never realized how much fur was on my carpet or blankets after the dryer.",

    "description": "Product Description\nTired of bulky water bottles leaking in your bags?\n\nA lot of people are always on-the-go, raising the need for more portable and convenient items.

This is the perfect compromise between utility and convenience; they usually offer enough of a capacity for the liquid to facilitate the average workout session and they’re portable enough to be stored in a backpack or gym bag.

Unlike rigid water bottles that are full of hot air when empty, it is foldable and can be rolled, folded or flattened and tucked away.

It was very easy to fit my iPhone in — I have a 13 Pro Max, and I didn’t have to remove it from its case. I’m still going through the hundreds of videos and photos I took. I’d say the results seem to be 50% good shots and 50% blurry-because-the-focus-was-on-the-bag shots. It’s important to set your phone to camera app before going underwater; the touch screen will not recognize your finger beneath the surface. Once underwater, use the upper volume button to take photos or to stop/start recording videos. Much easier than continually surfacing to use the touch screen. You won’t get the clarity of a GoPro, but for easy underwater photos this works just fine… just make sure to properly seal the bag according to the instructions. My husband didn’t. His phone is okay, but he switched to his GoPro after that.",

        "content": " I don't swim, but I love watching life under the ocean. I snorkel at the beach, not out at the reefs. I first tested this case by putting a paper towel in it and weighting it down in the sink at home for about 1/2 hour. No seepage. None in my husband's case either. On our Florida trip, I used it with my Iphone 12 in it and my husband on land with his Iphone 6. Mine took beautiful clear photos underwater, and initially I was having no problems with the touch screen in the case. It worked well when out of the water. In fact, the case and neck cord are particularly helpful when you are taking the glass bottom boat ride at John Pennakamp State Park, Key Largo, FL because you can't drop your phone in the water when using it, and it is protected from spray when you are at the bow of the boat going out to where the viewing area is. I easily added my driver's license and credit card to the case (making sure they were below the camera lens) and my mind was safely at ease that my valuables were protected. One difficulty is that- when you are actually in the water at a beach, and the sun is out, the reflection makes it hard to view the phone screen selections (even without the waterproof case)+ the added water drops on the outside of the case. My phone got warmer, as I was in the water for about 45 minutes each state park we visited, and the case started \"fogging\" inside, as the water was cool-furthering the difficulty of seeing the phone screen clearly while you are trying to take photos either in or out of the water. When I was taking photos under the water, I couldn't clearly see the phone screen due to the fogging and found later that many of my underwater photos somehow went to video...and the videos were very short; almost \"snaps\" of the activity I was trying to capture. Because of the wave activity, and standing in the water using the snorkel instead of floating (because I was afraid of drifting out over my head), I was buffeted about + my feet in the bottom silt would cloud the water as I was off balance. So when I saw a school of fish, I just tried, without focusing, to keep rapidly hitting the shutter button to capture as much as I could of the action below me. Obviously, sometimes I wasn't hitting the shutter, but either sliding to video or whatever. Quite a few of my intended to be video videos had the notation \"unsupported\" when I loaded them to my pc at home. I must have blindly hit something else??? Very disappointing. Some of the intended still photos came out \"EA-xxxx\". All of this must be operator error, as the touch and slide worked beautifully through the case when dry on the outside and taking photos out of the water environment. I did have a great time using the case, and took videos and stills that I never could have taken without this case, so I would recommend it....just be aware of what could happen in the hands of someone like me. I don't use face recognition. When the camera was warm, it was difficult immediately removing the I-phone from the case without danger of splitting the case seams near the opening, but in a few minutes the problem dissipated as the phone cooled and the fogginess left the case. I am posting a still shot of some type of lobster with a forked tail which ran across my foot and then hid under a rock, Bahia Honda State Park, Big Pine Key, FL and a video of fish at Fort Zach State Park in Key West, FL. I had silted up the water with my feet, so not an issue with the case. The fish at Bahia Honda around the beach tend to be brown, while the ones farther south at Fort Zach beach in Key West were colorful and only a couple of yards out. The birds were taken using the case on dry land at John Pennakamp.",

I think most infant toys are novelty but not in a productive way, but this is truly a great product and you really get a bang for your buck and you get all the best things you would wish for your kid when you give him something to help him with his development or coming pain issues, as well as the aforementioned tongue articulation and so forth",

        "content": "While these aren't expensive binocs, they worked quite well, for a while. I have to admit I bought them 2 years ago, so they are undoubtedly past warranty - but they've spent almost all that time in a drawer in our RV (maybe a total 30 minutes use!). Tried to use them yesterday, and the focusing wheel just spins. I really expected more, and hope that this is just a fluke. Another pair purchased at nearly the same time are still working great. Disappointed, but they were good while they lasted.\n\nEDIT (UPGRADED TO 5 STARS; HERE'S WHY): I don't often review a product I've purchased. I generally assume they'll be as advertised, and if not I'll just figure it's the luck of the draw. The thing is, I really liked these binoculars, so when they crapped out on me I was totally disappointed, and wanted to warn others that while they were nice binocs, they just might not last like they should. I didn't expect anything from Aurosports, but a few days after I posted my 2-star review I got an email from them asking if I would like to have a replacement. (They even asked if both binocs I purchased had gone bad, but I told them it was only the one.) They offered to replace them, and I accepted their offer. Today a new binocular was delivered, and I'm so happy! Thank you to Aurosports for going above and beyond! Good binocs to be sure, and outstanding customer service!",

So far only I’ve used it to clear a couple of inches deep snow as well as some ice on my Jeep Wrangler’s windshields and side windows. It clears the snow easily with the brush and the scraper end clears the ice fairly easy. It seems to be durable and made well. My Wrangler is lifted so it’s high off of the ground so I wasn’t sure if the 27 inches of length would be enough, it is. I can reach over half of the windshield with it before I switch to the other side. I will update my review if it breaks or anything but it seems like it will last plenty long.",

This design is intended to reduce hand fatigue and provide a more secure grip, which can be helpful for people who are using the scissors for extended periods of time. Additionally, the scissors come in a bulk pack of 3, which can be a cost-effective option for those who need multiple pairs of scissors.\n\nOverall, the iBayam Multipurpose Scissors are a decently designed pair of scissors that could be useful for a wide range of tasks.

The straw was absolutely perfect! It's also thick that it won't break easily and looks well made with no weird rims.\n\nMy only complaints is 1) the tops and 2) some minor chipping. The tops feel good but they don't stay and are loose. I wouldn't recommend it as a traveling item or in a fast car since it'd def spill. I only use the top when inside my home (rarely) but it's not too bad if you want to use in an office setting or just around the house.\n\n1-2 glasses were kind of chipped at the bottom inside or outside but it was very small and unnoticeable unless you're looking (I was). It was only a bit bothersome cause I'm a bit OCD about things like that but it's not as big of a problem since the glass didn't break or anything or have little shards. Might have been a shipping problem, not sure tho.\n\nIn all, I'm satisfied with the overall product (the tops aren't really much of a concern for me but maybe to others)! Would buy some more in the future.",

This one is amazing from start to finish. Easy to load, pretty easy to pull out of the mold, perfectly clear, we've made about 8 since receiving last week and haven't broken one yet. It is so worth the extra money over a $10-$15 one. The little extra storage bag works great as well to have some on hand and allowed me to just buy the 2 ball mold to save some cash. We took some advice from reviewers here about using warm water at a certain temp - but after a couple of times we just went with warm tap water, and even that is working just fine....and we have a very old gas water heater that takes forever, so I think we were only at about 80 degrees? Still clear as could be. Agree with others - this is finally one that works as advertised!",

The ice lasts about 4 refilled\nglasses before it goes away, and that's with room temperature drinks. So, it's pretty cool. I would recommend getting 2 of these bad boys for optimal utilization because I don't know about anyone out there, but I drink a lot of liquids. But if you just want to use these ice spheres for casual drinking with 1 or 2 glasses a day, just the 2 ice spheres will do you just fine.

It works better than I could have imagined. The case is very sturdy with a heavy duty zipper and handle that feel like they will withstand a lot of use. It is a fabric-covered hard case and feels like it is going to do an excellent job of protecting its contents. Inside, each container holds at least 1 packet of most seeds. I cut out the name from each seed packet and curled it around the inside of the container. Worked out great - you can see thru the container to see the name & how many seeds you have. I love that the containers have a screw on lid - extra protection against spilling and from the weather just in case the case gets left outside. Also, the containers are held in place with a dense foam insert. You can put them in alphabetical order and they stay that way making it easier to find what you are looking for. Couldn't ask for a better product.",

The jars are SMALL. I got the one with 2 levels. I definitely recommend the 2levels. Definitely smells like burnt rubber when you get it. The green trays are nice. The white one would be nicer if the neck wasn’t bent and my rhinestones could flow easily. The tweezers are useless. The little pens are plastic but work well and the wax is also very useful. Very nice for travel proposes and organizing. The labels are super small, but work with regular ink or felt tip pens.",

However, unless you have full containers, you cannot see the drills in the container even if you flip the entire pad over you still don’t see them because they’re on the other side.

The finger protectors on the tool stretched out after three nights of use. I see a lot of complaints about the funnel. Best put it large size down and push down initially and then use your finger nails to put it back together. It definitely could be a little more pliable.",

Some care is needed to keep the coffee mixture in the cup as this little blender is so powerful, but with some precautions (big cup, less liquid than you think, more powder than you think to thicken, blend a bit to the side of the cup) the results are perfectly smooth in a very short period of time. A quick rinse with hot water immediately after leaves it pretty clean, a bit of soap every once in a while to make sure.\n\nSimilar products I've used in the past were nowhere near powerful enough to get the job done that this one can. This is an excellent solution for difficult to blend beverages without dirtying the blender. This even worked better for this task than a plug-in immersion blender I have.

After setting it aside for a while, and coming back to a dead frother, I replaced the batteries and it's like new. Five stars.\n\nI used this for frothing mile for coffee, and it was very good for that - at first. The issue I think is that the main stem is fairly small gauge stainless, more like a thick wire than a thin rod, so it ended up easily being very slightly bent. A very very small amount of bending essentially ruins the product for its intended purpose, because once off center, it cannot be put right. So the spinning is slowed down too much to be able to froth milk any longer. It can stir the milk around, but no longer froth as it did before in got off center. Most certainly my fault, i did not take care of it well enough. So, if you get one, ONLY use it to froth milk, and never set down or lean it against the side of a container. Only put it in the included little stand.",

We don’t have a dishwasher though, and I can’t recall if this bottle is dishwasher safe. But it is hard to hand wash. There’s a whole section in the handle where the liquid can go, but you can’t reach it without some sort of specific brush. We use it for water so it’s no big deal.

        "content": "The unit (though I saw the videos and read the measurements) is larger than I thought. But it does do the job.\n\nPackaging: the box comes wrapped in sealed plastic. And that is the hardest part. Clearly, they realise that people with limited hand strength might be buying this and they made packaging to match. Once the plastic is off, there are easy hold tabs and grasping points to allow you to safely remove the device without getting frustrated. Bonus point to them.\n\nBattery compartment: This is easily removed. But not easy to replace. The grooves don't line up easily and there is a gap after. I'll fiddle with it some more, but didn't want to stress anything. It is plastic afterall. It holds 4 AA batteries\n\nInstructions: written in a small manual or via a video via a QR code. They are simple to follow and concise. No confusion.\n\nOperation: Works as advertised. Just follow the instructions and there will be no slivers of metal in the food. The sound does not change when it makes a full circuit, so simply set the device and remember the starting position and stop it when it gets back to that position. Note that the device will need space around the tin to make its circuit, so clear the area. The lid came off easily with a tight grasp to top and a tilting motion (might have to slip a fingernail underneath). No rough edges. No part of the unit was in the food.\n\nRemember to store it so that the button is not likely to be depressed by anything, and remove the battery if not using regularly. The unit has no strange odour straight out the box.\n\nNow then, the safety point.\n\nIMPORTANT: When I slipped in the last battery, the unit started right up! Not cool. Remember that the likely holding position is blade down, in your palm. Shocked me that it would do that. Took 3 presses of the button (possibly because I just wanted it to stop immediately) before it stopped. So please be careful about that. Star removed.\n\nMisc: there is another QR code for a chance to win something - doesn't work. But that would just have been a bonus and clearly does not affect use of the unit.\n\nOverall: decent device, works as intended, clean cut, easy lid removal. However, IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE on battery installation.",

I have had two now and have been waiting for a new one to be delivered which apparently got lost somewhere.

I think it is a good solution for an older person with bad arthritis or someone like me with a ruptured bicep tendon where turning a hand can opener is too painful. I also like it because I can be doing other things while the cans are being opened. My dogs like that too!",

Its method of opening is unconventional, which takes a bit of getting-used-to, but it works well. It's especially helpful for people with arthritic hands, since it doesn't require any \"strength\" in the hands, or twisting. One drawback: the battery compartment is difficult to open, and the instructions recommend removing batteries when the device will go unused for long periods.

        "content": "At last I can actually BREATHE (literally!!) a HUGE sigh of relief! We simply couldn’t be more delighted with this Humidifier!\n\nIt definitely seems like the rest of the world was enlightened while I was kept in the dark about the fact that numb toes, chattering teeth and the flu are not necessarily the most perilous part of winter!\n\nI recently moved to New York from Florida. I was beyond excited to experience the 4 seasons, despite knowing that I might have to dig my way out of 2 ft of snow at times, and the dangers of blizzards and black ice.\n\nHowever, what NO ONE prepared me for was this DREADFULL DRYNESS that lasts HALF A YEAR and makes me feel literally like HALF A HUMAN! I’m NOT kidding.\n\nSeriously, how do people FUNCTION? As soon as the cold set in I began waking up with a terrible thirst and dryness. My tongue felt like sandpaper against the roof of my mouth and my voice could barely croak in the morning. My nose was somehow wet and stuffed, yet dry and burning all at once! (Blowing my nose just caused a nosebleed!) My eyelids literally pasted to my eyeballs and if by some miraculous chance, despite feeling like this, I DID wake up feeling cheery enough to grin…. I daren’t allow the slightest smile to stretch across my lips lest they sprout half a dozen bloody cracks!! OUCH. And EWWW. What the hell???!!!\n\nBut the worst was still waking up all cotton brained and headachy! Copious amounts of coffee didn’t do a darn thing to lift the fog so I could function! I was feeling so terrible I began thinking I was suffering from depression. I never felt so awful in my life!\n\nThen my 3 year old came down with a really nasty cold that left a lingering dry cough lasting about a week after all the other symptoms were gone. Maddeningly persistent at night, it would simply disappear without a trace in the morning. It was really hard to watch her suffer so much! She’d wake herself up as her whole body wracked with these coughs! I was seriously at the brink of my sanity!!! Every night I’d swear that I’d be at the Doctors office first thing in the morning and every morning she woke up “all better” so no need! After one nightly coughing attack caused her to VOMIT I got my fat a$$ to the Pediatrician because by then I was really alarmed.\n\nDoctor was cool as a cucumber “Welcome to winter and I’m willing to bet you guys have central heat at home…” Well, I sure do! It was the BEST perk of our new apartment not having to worry about the kids touching radiators! Who knew it only aggravated this winter dry air situation?! Who knew there WAS a winter dry air situation?! Not me! That’s for sure!\n\nHe suggested getting a Humidifier and I was sure I heard wrong! I use a DE-humidifier so that my clothes could dry faster than it could start smelling of mold if I hung it to dry indoors!\n\nWe got a decent Humidifier actually that we THOUGHT was effective and we were happy with (even though it leaked! I thought that was just part of it!)……Until it broke after a few weeks and the company refused to send us a new oneL! After being stiffed once, I did some research and settled on the AquaOasis. Had some awesome reviews, looked sleek and strong, and loved that it has a built in self filtering feature. (And boy, it even passed my husband’s curiosity test. Happens to be an electrician and has this thing with electronics! 🙄\n\nAnyway, the price was well worth it and this operates in virtual silence! I literally need to put my ear to the machine to hear a soft low hum… Nothing like the grating ruckus of my previous one!\n\nBeen using this for a few weeks and simply couldn’t be happier! I feel sooo much better! My daughters cough is totally gone and I wake up feeling well rested, invigorated and ALIVE! Headaches are gone, my eyeballs aren’t in a “sticky relationship” with my eyelids anymore and I’m not scared my lips’ll “pop” if I laugh by mistake!! I feel so exhilarated, so alive…so, well…HUMIDIFIED!! It sounds cliché but it’s TRUE!!!!!! Best investment ever!\n\n….AND…. I saved the best part for last here …. Do you know what THE FREAK’N HELL I DISCOVERED folks??! My Psoriasis and eczema improved so dramatically that I came right back here to buy one for my mom who suffers from eczema too! I tell you these Humidifiers are the BEAST!\n\nAnyway, will keep you posted if anything changes but so far so good! I just wish all of life’s problems were so easily and neatly fixable!\n\nStay warm folks… and HUMIDIFIED ;)!",

Let me just say I was pleasantly surprised with this product wait...So first off when I opened the Amazon box the item had outside damage to the box it was packaged in now I'm like uh oh here we go. Then I opened it and found that the power switch wasn't in place properly I'm like see this is what I'm talking about everytime I order online its something. So I gently put the knob in properly then I say now let me see if it works properly and to my surprise it worked pretty good now its been a month and a half it's still going strong exceeding my expectations. The only thing I gotta say it took some time to get the correct mist setting after waking up to my bedding feeling damp and my window all wet. They say its cool mist not really it kinda too cold for me. It was putting out some heavy mist there for a minute so I worked with the setting a few days and now I got the perfect setting still a little on the cold side for me but that not too bad I just bundle up under my blankets. It was using a lot of water there too I'm thinking because the setting was too high and I've only used distilled water I went through about 5 gallons in 1 and half months. Now with the right setting I hope to go through less still a on the cold side even on a lower setting. But other than that this one is a winner. I'd recommend. Oh yeah it also helped with me waking up so dry I use to wake up with my throat so dry I could barely swallow for the first 1 to 2 hours of being awake now I don't have that problem. If you have a dry house like me you should get this one I only use it at night not sure how it would handle during the day. But its got a 👍🏽 from me.",

        "content": "This is a very small, but effective, misting humidifier. It is mostly good, but I do have a couple of observations after using it for part of a day and overnight. First, it is impossible to totally fill the already small tank. Even if you add water to the point where it starts to overflow as you fill it when you turn it over and put it on the base, a significant portion of the water goes into the base so that the tank is about 3/4 of the way full before you even turn it on. Second, you absolutely have to use the cap/spout, otherwise, it just shoots a cloud straight up into the air that then comes back down and gets whatever you have it sitting on wet. The cap allows you to control the direction the mist goes and makes it finer so it is not just a huge cloud of water. Third, if you dial it up to full power, which is pretty much required if you have a large room (especially if you also have vaulted ceilings) it will not run an entire night. I turned it on at about 8:30 PM and it was shut off before I woke up in the morning. Finally, it will shut off even when there is a bit of water left in the tank and there will be water in the base when you take the tank off. Just be aware of that because if you lift the tank without being careful you will get water on the table or shelf you have this on.\n\nUltimately, I do think that this is a good deal, but, for $30 it would be nice if the tank was a little bit bigger so that it could run longer. I do like the auto shut-off feature when the water gets low so you are not running the motor when it is not doing anything, which should allow it to last longer. That said, the big plus is that it does not require a filter, so you do not have to keep paying to use it after you buy it. And, you do not have to take it apart and risk breaking it in order to clean the parts that need to be cleaned from time to time. So overall, it is a good deal.",

        "content": "I really like/love this humidifier. I don't like filters and this one does not need one. It's the best humidifier I've had. I waited to review so I knew it was good. I had an old one I loved and used it for years and years and it finally died. i had a hard time replacing it as I bought 2 diff kinds that were no good. So i went years without. Finally took a chance on this one and so glad I did. Works like a charm. Lasts at least 8 hours and flashes when running low. also shuts off. Ive had no problems and none mentioned in comments. Someone said they had overflow problems but I can't even see how that could happen.\n\nThe tank can look like it's in place when it is not quite so you have to kind of jiggle it to make sure it's all the way in its place. It will act funny if the tank is a little askew which you can't really see in some cases esp if you are looking down on it from above. So I just jiggle it a little until I can tell it's perfectly in place and can't jiggle. by jiggle i mean it just moves a little. when in place it won't move and you can tell. Puts out lots of moisture. My dogs lay under the stream for max humidity sometimes. I live in cold country and the furnace really makes the air dry on cold days. I thought it was too small but it does the job of a big one so that's not a problem and it's neater and fits more places.",

That's why I was excited to try this Cool Mist Humidifier in their bedrooms.\nOverall, I've been happy with this humidifier. It does a great job of adding humidity to the air and making the room feel more comfortable. The adjustable 360 rotation nozzle is also helpful because I can direct the mist exactly where I want it as it really does shoot out, although the nozzle can be a little loose feeling.\nOne thing to note, though, is that it doesn't last as long as the product description claims. I found that I had to refill the water tank every 12-14 hours or so. But it's not a big deal, and it's a common issue with humidifiers in general.\nThe humidifier is good at adding moisture to the room, which is especially helpful when my kids have colds. I like that it's quiet and has an auto-shut off feature, so I don't have to worry about it running dry and causing damage.\nOverall, I would recommend this humidifier to other parents who want to improve the air quality in their homes. It's easy to use, easy to take care of, and will help you and your family breathe a little easier.",

Our home is so dry with the heat running, and it has done wonders for the difference of humidity in the air.\nI like how easy the design is. There’s nothing special about it, and that’s what I was looking for. I wanted a humidifier that did what it said it would.\nFor the most part, it’s incredibly quiet. On occasion, it does that bubbling thing where you can hear the water shifting around in the base. It holds a large amount of water and I typically run it on low/medium and just leave it alone. There’s no obnoxious light that lights the room up for those who are sensitive to needing a dark room to sleep.\nI do wish it was a too full because it’s just so annoying to have to take it off the base, drip water everywhere, and then turn it upside down to refill it. That being said, I knew it was a bottom fill but because of the other factors, I figured it was worth the exchange. I was right.\nIt’s a great running humidifier. Quiet, holds a large amount, and other than some occasional bubbling, I forget that it’s running.",

That being said, I use this when I had the flu and Covid recently where I thought I was dying. My throat was so dry from being unable to breathe through my nose. I turn this on, and spend the nozzle to face me (nice feature by the way) and I do think it helped quite a bit. It runs for a long time, it’s very quiet but it’s kind of soothing to listen to, really, no complaints at all for me.

You have to hold it with one hand while holding the gallon of water, if full, can be pretty challenging to work with.

        "content": "I got this particular scale for two reasons. One is that is has a high capacity of 22 lbs. My current scale does not go that high, and I’ve run into the limit once or twice. The second reason is that unlike other models, this scale has an elevated surface above the LCD, so it won’t be covered when weighing something that’s larger than the surface. It’s a problem that I’ve encountered with my current flat scale.\n\nMy first reaction was that it was small… Well, smaller than my current scale. My second reaction was that, while I wasn’t sure about this when ordering because I thought it might be bulky, it is not, and would be easy to find a place to keep it.\n\nThe scale is packed very well, with foam strips between the weighing surface and the scale to prevent it from movement and being damaged in transit. There is very little non-recyclable material in the packaging.\n\nThe LCD is nice and bright. The instruction card is pretty small, though it does explain usage, which is pretty obvious. One thing that is not mentioned in the instructions is that to turn off the scale, you have hold the power button for a few seconds. If you don’t use the scale it will turn off automatically after 2 minutes. There is a hold button, shared with the units button. The instructions don’t describe this button, but in the reviews I read that it will keep the scale on for 5 minutes of non-use instead of 2 minutes. This is helpful if you’re retrieving or cutting ingredients, or want the tare value to remain for a longer period of time.\n\nI happened to have a 50g weight for calibration on another scale I have. I checked the scale and in fact it read 50 grams in most locations on the surface. If I moved the weight to a corner or edge, if it did vary, it never went below 49g or above 51g, within the tolerance of the unit. I’m confident the weight will be accurate.\n\nSo far I am very pleased with this scale, and plan to stop using the larger Polder scale I’ve been using until now.",

        "content": "So I purchased this about a year and half ago and have used it almost every day since and it has held up perfectly and is one of my go to kitchen tools for my weight loss journey. When counting calories it is best to weigh foods for most accurate calorie count and I do this day in and day out multiple times a day and I still haven’t had to change the first battery I put in this scale. I have a spare battery tucked away that came with it but have yet to use to. I love the color and I love the size. Easy to store and travel with if needed - I’ve taken this on multiple vacations and weekend trips. The buttons are more touch style than a press style so it did take me a couple uses to get the hang of that but now I can quickly switch between measurement units and zero out the scale. It wipes clean easily too which is nice. It has little rubberized feet to keep it from sliding on your counter which is also a nice well thought out feature. When I purchased this scale I figured for the price it would be a great starter scale and that I would just upgrade once I got the hang of weighing foods and by then it would have stopped working…. Nope! Still going and still awesome! If you’re trying to lose weight and are considering weighing your food this is a great scale to get you started. You can’t beat the price and the multiple color options are nice! It’s very basic but it’s absolutely fabulous anyways. I highly highly recommend this scale.",

In fact, I would give it a solid five stars.\n\nOne of the things that I appreciate about this food scale is its long-lasting battery life. I have had issues in the past with food scales constantly draining their batteries, which can be frustrating and inconvenient. However, this scale has held up really well and I have not had to replace the battery nearly as often as I did with my previous scale.\n\nAdditionally, I love the sleek design of this scale. It is modern and stylish, and looks great in my kitchen. It is also very easy to use, with a simple interface that allows me to quickly and accurately measure my ingredients.",

If you just wanna know if it’s a good product then stop here, yes it is. If you wanna hear my story with the spawns of Satan then read on ..\nI caught my case pretty early because I am terrified of bugs. That’s not to say I only had one or two. When I started waking up with bites, and literally feeling them crawl on me I finally did a thorough inspection. BOOM! Right near my feet was a nest. I’ve never been more scared in my life! Grabbed a credit card and tupperware and scraped the whole end into it, then hurried and sealed it shut. Called my landlord the next morning and someone came and confirmed what I already knew. To say I freaked out was an understatement. When he told me he was behind and could take weeks to come do I’m pretty sure I had a mini heart attack. Now you should know I live in low income housing and they have to treat it (thank God) but weeks?!? I have 2 kids and my youngest carries his blanket around like the Charlie Brown boy. Let me also add that before I knew I had them I would bring my bed blanket out to the living room in the morning. UGH!! The first thing I did after my panic attack was buy some DE. Literally dusted all sides of my bed and box spring in it. I then dusted heavily around all four sides of my bed. After that I laid down three strips of double sided tape at the entrance of my bedroom, added more DE, and closed the door. Once on the other side I completely sealed off my bedroom with those plastic tarps and heavy duty tape. I then once again laid down a thick layer of DE and 2 more strips of double sided tape. If one of them could have made it through my wall of China I would have shook his hand and gave him a pat on the back! I also opened up the bedroom window so they wouldn’t smell my CO2 and try to come to me. Figured if the window was open that maybe it would throw them off. I have no idea if it worked or not. But they never showed up in my sons room. They say not to sleep in another room cause they’ll just follow but I’d rather eat a roach then spend a minute in that room. Luckily my 14 year old has severe OCD and absolutely nothing in his room except 2 dressers, his tv and chair and his bed. Let me add here that I immediately bought the climb ups, sent my oldest to his fathers for a few weeks and slept in his bed. All outlets that weren’t in use were taped up, layered! The ones I had already caught I decided to have them be my test subjects. I put some DE in there then taped it back up and waited. It’s true that DE doesn’t work immediately but I notice it def stuck to them and even made it hard for them to stay on their feet. They kept flipping upside down. In another container I just had them in there and taped the lid. My landlord said they can suffocate after awhile. WRONG! For four weeks I watched them walk around like it was their home. They don’t suffocate, even vacuum sealed they still have enough oxygen to live awhile!! But by day 2 the DE did its job, they were def dead! But unfortunately I still had to go into the room of death to clean it out for the pest guys. I put trash bags over my shoes, taped it real good, and used doctor gloves for my hands which also was taped around my wrists. How did I get in and out of that bedroom you might ask. Well luckily I live on the first floor and went in and out thru the window. Basically anything I haven’t used in a year went straight to the trash. The things I did need and wanted to keep were doubled bagged, sealed tight and brought outside. Things I couldn’t wash or get wet went into a storage container with DE. Oh and to the person who showed video that they can’t climb scotch tape you deserve an award my friend! Anyway I put those certain things into the container with the DE and put scotch tape along the entire top of the bin inside, so if they were in any of those things and tried to climb out by the time the reached the scotch tape they fell right back down into the DE. Like one person said, make friends with garbage bags cause you will be living outta them. I bagged things that needed washed, threw the tightly sealed bags out the window and then double bagged them again before getting put in my car to be dried. They say 30 mins high heat kills them, but like I said these things paralyzed me so i did 40-50 most times, especially with clothes close to the bed. Everything on the bed went right into the trash, I was too scared to even touch them, except for my pillow, no literally, I have one of those My Pillows and it’s amazing. I washed that then fried it. Bought a couple cheap pillows, put the freshly washed pillow covers on and used double sided tape to seal off the ends. BTW, double sided tape works perfectly to seal shut ur pillows instead of also buying pillow cases! Before this my bed was on the floor, I didn’t have a bed frame, so I bought a metal one from Walmart for 32$! Not bad to get ur bed off the floor right! After the treatment I put both the mattress and box spring protectors on, set up the metal bed frame, used scotch tape on each leg maybe an inch down from the frame, and put climb ups on the feet of them. I also dusted DE in each one just to be safe. And if one did happen to get on my bed and go down to it’s hiding spot or whatever they weren’t able to climb back up with the scotch tape there! Luckily 4 weeks later the pest guys came and did their thing, I reduced a lot of clothes and whatnot that has been sitting in my room for years and finally after weeks of sleeping in a tent then my teenagers room I was finally able to break down the Great Wall and open my bedroom for business again! Trust me, if ur reading this whole thing you’re prob like I am and becoming a bedbug expert. I highly suggest buying both protectors and even a new metal bed frame and climb ups if you can. If not then at least invest in some DE and scotch tape to dust everything you can and tape the legs of your bed so that they never get a chance to get to you again from the floor! Good luck my fellow insomniacs, you will win this battle!",

        "content": "Love this encasement! The price is great for the quality, and it has held up very well so far. We have had a Big Barker Dog bed (size giant) since 2015-ish. These beds are $400-$500. We have a 206lb Mastiff. Our dog bed has been used and abused, and Big Barker also didn’t make the waterproof covers when we purchased our bed. Plus, their covers are expensive! We needed an encasement to go over the bed but also to fit under the top cover, so I opted for this one. This encasement is a bit larger than our bed, but we just folded it over and put on the top cover. This product has really served its purpose- helped with the bed’s smell, protected the bed from wet dog and drool, and overall helped to extend the life of our dog bed. Would recommend to anyone!",

        "content": "Our apartment building has a problem with bed bugs and we wound up getting them in the living room, now doing our best to keep them out of our bedroom, so far no sign in there. Got this cover to prevent them from taking hold in the mattress just in case. This is nice and soft for the mattress, while the box spring below is now taped inside a giant plastic bag meant for use while moving. I like that it has strong velcro right over where the zipper stops and it is very bright white, which will make it easy to see anything in case they get up on the bed. It doesn't feel or sound so plasticy as other covers, however it does have a thin lining of plastic like stuff on the inside, but you can't tell from the outside; it's nice and soft!\n\nAnyone who's interested, here's some other stuff we've been doing, hope it works:\nWe already had a metal bed frame, and I think it might be what saved us so far. I invested in a steamer that goes for 40 minutes and used it all over the furniture, carpet, and in cracks and baseboards.\nI got some carpet sliding things for each foot of all furniture. These I chose instead of interceptors because we also put a smooth piece of packers tape on each leg, which hopefully will do that job of keeping them from crawling up, while the carpet sliders make it easy to move the furniture to steam and vacuum the carpet each week (and to re-treat every month or so).\nPesticides we are using: a light dusting of food grade DE, barely perceptible is what I heard is best, so they will crawl right over and through, rather than around it. We used this in cracks and crevices and in the groove of each carpet slider. We got the one here on amazon that comes with a duster. I have used DE in the past without the aid of a duster and it is much harder to apply properly and DE can really easily get everywhere and make a big mess. Also Crossfire, really nice stuff, with clear easy to follow instructions.\nUnfortunately, like most apartment renters, we are subject to use a laundromat instead of a washer dryer in the unit. We bring our clothes there in pillowcases and toss the pillowcase in with the clothes. No need to use plastic bags IMO. We then us a hard plastic, smooth laundry basket, no grooves: make sure it's deep enough on the bottom so your clothes don't have a chance to touch the floor. We use this to pick up the laundry, it is cleaned off before and after. No clothing allowed on the floor, and for now we aren't using our dresser, just hanging everything up, socks and things like that inside a bag, hanging with everything else. And that's about it, so far so good. Good luck to all of you out there dealing with these mini vampires!! Breath, take care of yourself and do what you can to keep peace with your family too..it can be a stressful, exasperating thing :(",

They're all a pain in the butt when you've got to wrestle a mattress larger than you are.\n\n* Excellent for waterproofing. I have 4 cats and 3 kids who play on my bed and my spouse and I will occasionally eat and drink on it. There have been pet and child potty accidents and several spills and none made it through to the mattress.\n\n* Great for the flap over the zipper pull. Other brands I've tried have much more difficult and less effective ways to hide the zipper and protect the opening there.\n\n* Excellent for low noise and little bulk under the sheets. This was on an 11 inch king size memory foam mattress, so if yours is thinner you'll have more wrinkles than I did.\n\n* Poor for washability. Even though I followef the instructions carefully the layer inside wrinkled up badly, so I think it's delaminated and that makes it trash as it's no longer waterproof or bug proof. It's also nearly impossible to dry. Put it on and forget it. I wouldn't have removed mine at all if I hadn't gotten a new mattress and decided to try to wash it before installing it on the new one.",

        "content": "I purchased 7 of these mattress encasement's and 1 box spring encasement's . They are such a BLESSING . Whatever these tiny black specs are they are not able to get thru these wonderful encasements ..I would give these a 200% satisfaction. Amazon doesn't have enough star ratings for this product or company..My review is a little long for some maybe, but maybe very helpful for others, who can't figure out what they are dealing with. Wasn't sure what we had, Thought it was bad thinking we were fighting fleas from animals...until I found a bug around my bed (which turned out to be a tick which can be mistaken as bedbug) then pulled mattress covers off and seen a creepy translucent thing looking at me.(turned out to be baby silver fish.) I live in a very wooded area with ponds and natural springs every where.. I freaked out... Then little black specks everywhere and small like white soft cocoons every where..And when I tried to vacuum the black specs seemed to dig into fabrics...was sure it was BEDBUGS until I started looking every where and found in kitchen, in staples , on furniture ( just laying there on top not moving) , drawers , inside fridg. ,dressers,laminate floors...you name it...in our new RV (Used 2016). Thinking Camping World didn't sanitize the mattresses .. Found them laying on top of leather seat counters , floors ect...\n....Leaned against mattress in RV to grab something in cupboard started feeling bites on knees..cleaned off with white paper towel sure enough.. black specs that don't move.Bombed whole house and RV with the hotshot bedbug which has the insect growth regulator {NYLAR} ...Finally last week was directed to a an employee at Ace Hardware that has an RV and camps A LOT...KNEW exactly what it was...some call them( noisome ) or something like that because can't really see them unless you wipe area feeling bites with something white..can't believe it was so easy called {POLLEN MITES } that fall from trees with flowers or anything that hangs from trees and they love oak trees..he said his wife thinks he's nuts but he said you find them in other places you go in buildings ,stores ,garages ,( I said yes I was looking in the stairwell of my moms apt. building and even seen them there .)their every where and they get picked up on your clothes, shoes, dogs, cats, bird feeders on you porch, Ferraro cats(I was even blaming the used RV hadn't had but few months.).I was happy to hear from the start, that I would have bites from bedbugs, that you could see and I didn't even find bites when I was bit by the black specs . But could even feel biting on my head if I shook my head over sink area I would see black spec or specs that had fallen from head...Then I wouldn't feel biting anymore, and if I did I would rub head area harder with tips of fingers and sure enough would find more, then wouldn't feel bites anymore..So now I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel . But still using hot water in washer and dry for over 30 min. Run already cleaned Blankets pillows ect. through hot dryer for 35 min. every 3 to 4 days and will continue until absolutely feel they are gone.. Am still keeping all clothes in totes or bags and towels sheets ect. My husband is no longer coming in and sitting on our furniture after working outside and hes not leaving clothes lay with other laundry, he bags it until I wash...Hardly seeing any but will bomb every few months as directed on the can. .. and make sure we treat outside to help keep from picking up so many...I hope this review helps a lot to someone.. .And you are not crazy. Exterminators will not find anything when you call and say you still have something..Don't waste your money . Just make sure to spray with something that will kill mites ect...and if it does not say it has a I.G regulator in it you can buy one and add to it..I used MARTINS I.G REGULATOR {the 4 oz bottle $19 HALLS can treat up to 5000 sq ft,or 1 oz bottle $9 Walmart online] and bug blaster indoor/outdoor which I got from Halls nursery think its an 8oz bottle $17,...can also order online on amazon. Others will pop up from other co. also like doyourownpest.com or something like that, if you prefer to order and save the running around trying to find .Don't bother with products from home depot, Lowe , or Walmart , unless the ones I listed.. and buy yourself a $10 insecticide pump sprayer..make sure to spray base boards . Can get different products to spay furniture ... I sprayed my underneath coach fabric with the bug blaster with I.G regulator mixture ,not the cushions... I did not really care to spend this much time on this review but really feel if it just helps one person it was worth every minute I spent explaining everything I dealt with..I have read alot of people frustrated trying to figure these noisome things out and people think your nuts. I feel so blessed that a real outdoors man encountered these things and knew that people call them noisome, but are really pollen mites. I had never heard of pollen mites either...",

I’m super busy and anything to save time without sacrificing quality, I’m game. I was worried this would be one of the many things I buy and use once before it gets buried in my cabinet. I’m happy to say I use this at least once a week when I’m doing my meal prep. It’s great with onions, peppers, celery, carrots, you name it! I like the size because it is compact but I sometimes have to quarter my veggies rather than halve then to fit over the slicer. Depends on if it’s a monster onion or the baby ones.\n\nThis thing is dishwasher safe which was a huge plus for me. Just beware that the blade plates are sharp! I accidentally cut my finger just grabbing the blade off the counter. Totally my bad, but just a heads up! This thing is amazing and I would buy it ten times over if something happened to mine!",

I purchased it for fun to try it out given I’ve been ordering meal subscriptions lately, and meal subscriptions are obsessed with having you chop stuff.\n\nThis thing really works! And the best part is, it almost makes cooking tolerable. Almost.\n\nPros:\n•This thing really works. (Notice the earlier foreshadowing.)\n•Easy to assemble.\n•Easy to disassemble and clean. I just put it in the dishwasher.\n•SHARP blades - ask me and my thumb how I know.\n•Easy to store. Decent size.\n•Takes mere minutes to chop veggies as opposed to hand chopping.\n•Multiple blades/attachments.\n•Great price.\n\nCons:\n•I can’t think of any. Will report back if something comes up.\n\nTip of the day:\n•You do have to slice smaller pieces for this to work. You can’t put half an onion on this thing and expect it to chop it, not unless you plan on standing on it. Smaller pieces = the way to be.",

Though with onions, it takes a lot of effort to force the oinion through the machine. The spiral blade was completely useless. I don't plan to use it again.\nIn the end, the amount of effort needed to chop veggies was a turn-off. The way to fix it is to use 25% of the capacity. Takes 4 times the repetitions, but the amount of time is probably the same because you're not using your entire body weight to chop veggies! Also reduces likelihood of tripping, accidents and injury.",

        "content": "First off, I gave it a 3 for ease of cleaning because the top part (the blunt block that pushes the veggie through) has like 100 small crevices, and if you've used this to dice anything that's a little soft (tomato, mushroom, etc) you're gonna get pieces stuck in there. And the crevices are so thin you can't just pick them out. You gotta blast them or actually dig with a be spatula. Pretty annoying but, they can't really design that part in a different way so doesn't really feel right to dock them for it. Would be like saying a burger is bad because beef gives you gas. Not the burger's fault, not yours, you get it.\n\nNow, to address many of the reviews talking about how you need a big man or you need to step on it. What? No no. Here's how you use the thing: lay the veggie on the blades, making sure none of it is touching the sides, but as far from the back (the side opposite the opening end) as possible, as the farther toward the back it is, the less it can close down before touching the veggie. Then push *with your normal strength*, until it's not going anymore. At this point, the cuts have started. If you just push, push, force slowly with umph, it can smush the softer veggies. No - what you do at this point is literally smack the thing down, (guys: like it just checked out your wife - ladies: like it just told you to smile more). Think of it like the difference between pushing a sword through something more slowly, vs just jabbing that som' b. with pinache. The cut will be more clean, and you will have momentum adding to it. You don't need to be strong to do this. I'm short enough that women don't swipe right on me in dating apps. I am smol man. But that thing, it checked out my imaginary girlfriend. I can't just let that slide. *WHOMP*, boom, cleanly diced tomato, only a little marinara snot.\n\nIf you're calling on a guy to do it, or you're stepping on it (can't believe that one, wow dude) you're definitely not getting the full appreciation. It's nice to just hit something now and then. And how often do you get to hit something and then cook it. This is called opportunity, my friends. This thing is amazing.\n\nNow onions don't make me cry. I make them cry.",

And even when I would somehow manage to get through half the onion I would give up and haphazardly chop the rest, hoping to avoid any fingers. It’d be unevenly cut and I would just tell my family “chew and swallow.” So my husband was tired of me whining about a first-world problem and got me this chopper to ease my sorrows. And it’s been awesome! The blades are super sharp (my index finger can attest to that) and it cleans up pretty well in the dishwasher. Sometimes there are small pieces of onion left behind but the provided bristle brush helps remove them. I also really love using it when I’m cooking with colorful vegetables because having all the pieces the same size is very aesthetically pleasing. So five stars!",

        "content": "I only use this to cut up onions for my food cart, but its 3 lbs a day and has cut them flawlessly. I'm not gentle with tools, and if the onion fits in the blade area, I jam that top down and cut it. Half an onion at a time, like it or not. ZERO ISSUES. I bought several from wally and broke them. So if you need a complaint, the durability is due in part to the plastic supports under the cutting body (smooth on top, compartment walls under) and it is fiddly to clean there. But food doesn't go there, kinda like a pan - always clean where its needed (inside), maybe imperfect where its not. Also, the little tool (that cleans the grid that presses the onions through) is ornery to pick up 50% of the time. You'll see... Anyway, the chopper, for my purposes is that close to perfect. OH! I almost forgot...if you touch the sharp side of the cutter, you're cut. I sharpen tools a lot in my wood shop, but this thing is scary sharp!",

        "content": "Update! (My original review is below)\nAfter using this washer for several months now, I wanted to update my review. I use this little thing almost daily, and it is still working like a champ! It was absolutely worth every penny. The only issues I've had have been 100% operator errors. If you pay attention to the size of load that you try to wash, and if you don't try to make this machine do more than it was designed to do, it should work great and last a good long while.\n\nThe one \"major problem\" I had turned out to be total user error. I squashed way too much into the spin side, and a sock fell out of the spinner into the cabinet under it. That is where water drains to before it goes into the drain hose. The sock blocked the opening to the drain hose, but I thought the whole machine had just stopped draining. Nope. Once I realized what had happened, I was able to nudge the spinner over just enough to reach down inside the cabinet and get the sock. Then it worked perfectly again.\n\nI am currently washing probably my millionth load in this washing machine, and it works exactly as it did when I first got it. Without a full size washing machine, this little gem has been a total life saver.\n\nBig take-aways: Keep in mind that this is a COMPACT washer. It was not designed to wash full-size load. Not even close. It is only able to handle VERY small loads, and you may have to experiment with that to know exactly how much it can wash at one time. Your idea of \"small\" and the machine's idea of \"small\" might be very different. It will wash small loads very well if you don't over-fill it.\n\nIt can handle AT MOST about two pairs of adult jeans OR two big bath towels OR a few T shirts OR a couple of hoodies. After filling the wash side, watch it as it agitates. If the clothes don't move around freely in the water, you have over-loaded it. Take some of the clothes out and try again. Also, the spin side won't necessarily handle everything that the wash side will. When I wash two pairs of jeans, I always have to spin them separately, one at a time.\n\n______________________________________\n\n(Tips at the bottom of this review)\nMY INITIAL EXPERIENCE:\n\nFirst, be easy on this machine. It is not a typical residential washer. Just because you can stuff the wash tub and spin tub to capacity doesn’t mean that won’t break the machine. This takes some patience and some getting used to. If you overload it, it’s going to break. If the clothes don’t move and agitate freely in the wash tub, it’s overloaded. If the spin tub knocks, it’s off balance. Any washer does this when a load is off balance.\n\nCHECK YOUR MACHINE before you use it just to be sure the wash tub and spin tub are clean inside. I believe my machine was either a return from another buyer, or else it had dampness inside the wash tub for some other reason. There was a LOT of mildew inside the wash tub around the top when I unboxed it. If I wasn't so big on inspecting things, I would not have seen it until probably much later, and I would have assumed it was from dampness after my own use.\n\nI cleaned off the mildew using a disinfectant cleaner and a sponge, and it came off completely. I was OK with that, even though I remain a bit annoyed at having to clean up a mess before I could use what I had assumed that I bought new. I don't know for a fact that my machine was a return. All I know is that there was mildew inside. It could theoretically have come from being stored in a humid environment, I suppose.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM ITS PERFORMANCE:\n\nThis is a LIGHT-duty washing machine, and it works perfectly fine for what it is. Although it says that it dries, what they really mean is that it spins. This is NOT a washer dryer combination machine, but I knew that when I bought it. It spins shockingly well. Clothes come out very much like they do with a full size machine. I'm super happy about that. Wringing out wet clothes sucks, and I don't have to do that. Because I am a fusser, I did lift the lid while it was spinning. I was happy to learn that the spin cycle shuts off if you lift the lid. If it's unbalanced, you can lift the lid and adjust the clothes.\n\nThis machine does spin, but not in the wash tub. When you drain the wash tub you will need gravity. The spin tub is separate -- the washing side of the machine where most of the water is does not spin.\n\nIf you put the machine inside a bathtub, you'll want to elevate it with something. That will keep water from running under the machine and risking electric shock or ruining the machine. I set mine on a platform beside the bathtub and dropped the drain hose over into the tub. It works fine that way.\n\nIf you have ordinary loads, this machine will handle them. If you wash a lot of jeans and sweatshirts, plan to spend a lot of time babysitting your laundry. You'll have to do them in multiple VERY small loads (one or two pieces per load) or else you'll burn up the motor and your clothes will not come clean because the machine won't be able to agitate them. Even if the amount of clothes will fit, the machine won't clean them if you add several heavy pieces. I'm looking at you, Levis and hoodies.\n\nMy first load was several small pieces. It washed totally fine. I washed several pairs of socks, several pairs of underwear, three basic T shirts, one short nightgown, and a couple of small hand towels together. The machine handled this load with ease.\n\nOn my second load, I washed two pairs of size 12 (American) women's Levis, and that is all. The machine did not like this load one little bit. It struggled HARD to agitate them. I added more water than I should have just to free up the clothes a bit and take some of the burden off of the motor, and I watched the machine like a hawk the whole time. I will wash jeans one-at-a-time from here on out. The spin cycle was fine spinning out one pair of jeans at a time.\n\nThis machine will not handle adult blankets and other similar heavy things. The wash cycle won't agitate them, and you'll burn up the motor trying. It should work fine for a basic set of full size sheets. I'll be finding out later today. :)\n\nSpinning the clothes is interesting. If you wash what this machine considers a full load, which is much smaller than a full load in a big machine, you can wash them all together. But when you spin them, you'll need to spin a few pieces at a time. I broke up my first load into three groups. The spin tub is about half the size of the wash tub.\n\nHOW TO USE IT:\n\nThe instruction booklet will give you the most basic of basic information, but it will not really tell you how to use the machine. You will want to watch some review videos (videos are priceless, trust me) and read reviews if you really want to know how to make it work in the real world. I would have made a video, but my bathroom is too small. I watched several videos before I used it the first time, so I had a basic understanding of the machine. This is definitely a participation-required kind of laundry experience. But that works for me because I've always been fussy about washing clothes anyway.\n\nThis machine is a twin tub. It has one tub for washing, and a separate tub for spinning. The instructions do not really explain exactly how to do this. I developed my own method.\n\nFirst, I fill the wash tub using the fill hose (it worked for me), and add detergent. I only used about 1/4 of the amount of detergent that I'd use in a big machine. I fill the tub to the \"H\" level marked inside the tub and add my clothes. Close the lid, turn the \"Select Switch\" dial (the one that says Soft, Standard, and Drain). Soft is for a gentle wash. Then turn the \"Wash Timer\" dial for anywhere from a 1 to 15 minute wash. The instructions tell you to turn on the machine before you begin. There is no power switch. Trust me, I looked. Turning the Wash Timer dial starts the machine. Only turn the dial clockwise, and don't try to force the timer back or ahead once it has started.\n\nThe machine will NOT automatically drain when the cycle ends. The cycle will stop, then you'll need to manually turn the \"Select Switch\" to the Drain settling. Water will come pouring out of the drain hose. I have my machine sitting on a platform beside the bathtub so gravity helps the water drain out.\n\nAfter those steps are done, move some of the clothes over into the spin tub. Put the little plastic cover over the clothes and press down on it a little. The cover is the loose plastic piece with perforations through it. Then close the machine lid. Switch the \"Spin Timer\" dial to however many minutes you like. I tend to go for the five minute spin.\n\nAfter you've spun out all of the clothes in that load, move everything back over to the wash tub and repeat the steps for washing, except this time you're rinsing. This is where you can add fabric softener, if you like. Then repeat the steps for spinning like before.\n\nABOUT USING THE FILL HOSE:\n\nI have seen many, many reviews showing that the fill hose won't fit any faucet. I must have lucked out. I unscrewed the aerator at the end of my bathroom sink faucet and removed it, and the end of the fill hose fit over it perfectly fine. No leaks whatsoever. My sink faucet is a high arc style and it's narrow. Your mileage will probably vary. I use one of the water inlets on the machine, because I don't really know what will happen if I use both. The instructions give you zero to go on with that. I just drop the end of the fill hose into the tub and turn on the sink faucet.\n\nIf the hose won't fit any of your faucets, you'll need a bucket to fill the machine, or, as I've seen some users do, you could use a shower sprayer or a kitchen sink sprayer.\n\nThe instructions say not to use the machine in any damp area, such as a bathroom or kitchen. Really? I would like someone to explain to me how to use a portable washing machine anywhere besides a bathroom or kitchen. I suppose if you have a washing machine hookup, you could use it there. But if you had that, you could probably buy a full size machine from a used appliance store for about the price of this portable one.\n\nAll in all, I am happy. The mildew inside my machine was gross, but it didn't ruin my whole day. I'm washing clothes like mad, and I don't have to load up laundry baskets and take them to my mom's house or to a laundromat. It's fussy and it's not a heavy duty machine. But that's OK. My clothes are clean, and that's the whole point.\n\nTIPS:\n\nThe drain setting on the Select Switch is only for the wash tub. Any water in the spin tub will always drain automatically. There is no way to prevent the spin tub from draining, even when the wash side of the machine is washing.\n\nWhen you're at the end of one wash load and spinning out your final rinse water, you can go ahead and start the next load in the wash tub. Just turn the wash dial to your setting so the wash tub will stop draining. The spin tub will still spin and drain while you're washing the next load.\n\nI do not use the fill inlet on the wash side of the tub. I drop the hose into the tub to fill it.\n\nIf you can use the fill hose (if it fits your faucet), you can do something kind of cool that big washers do. Connect the loose end of the hose to the water inlet for the spin tub. Start your spin cycle. Then turn on the water for a few seconds at a time. That pours water into the spin tub to flush fresh water through the clothes as they spin. If you leave the water on for too long, it can spray out the top, so be careful about that. I tend to pulse it on and off for a few seconds at a time during the first minute or two of the spin.\n\nIf you are concerned about conserving water, you can use this machine like the old twin tubs were designed to be used. REUSE YOUR WASH WATER! :) You'll need to have a laundry basket handy to do this, but it works great for loads that aren't super dirty. Here's how you do it. Wash your first load. When it's done, do not turn the dial to \"Drain.\" Leave it where it is. Pick up some of the clothes from the wash tub and squeeze out some of the water into the wash tub. Just enough to keep from dragging tons of water across the machine. Put those clothes into the spin tub and spin them out. When those are done, put them into a laundry basket to get them out of your way. Put your next load into the same wash water as before and turn on the wash timer dial.\n\nIf you don't use fabric softener (I use softener for clothes. I do not use softener for towels, because it makes them less absorbent) and if you can use your fill hose, you can do this another way. Wash your load, move it to the spin tub, then connect the hose to the water inlet on the spin tub. Add water as it spins. That way, you can rinse out the wash water as the clothes spin. Once that spin cycle is done, those clothes are washed AND rinsed, so they're completely done. No need to move them back to the wash tub for a full-tub rinse cycle.\n\nIf you're lucky and can use the fill hose like I can, you'll want to be careful. It is not sturdy in ANY way. I can already tell that there will be a time before too long when the hose begins to crack at the ends. I'm already looking around for some replacement hose and connectors that I will be able to use when that happens.\n\nFILL HOSE WORK-AROUND:\n\nNot using a fill hose makes this machine a lot less convenient. If the hose will not work for you at all, but you do have a bathroom or kitchen faucet or shower head that's threaded (meaning you can screw on or unscrew to remove the faucet aerator or shower head), you can easily make a hose that will fit.\n\nUnscrew either the faucet aerator (the little tip at the end of the faucet) or remove the shower head. Take the aerator or shower head with you to your local hardware store or big box home improvement store. Talk to someone in plumbing. Most shower heads are universal, but you might want to take it with you just in case. Tell them what you're trying to do. Tell them that you need a connector to fit that size and style of connection so you can connect a standard garden hose to it. If you already know some plumbing, you can do this yourself. If not, they will be able to help you. If you don't know plumbing and grab any connector that you see, you might not get the right size.\n\nAt home, you'll twist the connector that they gave you onto the faucet or the shower. Then you'll twist on the end of your garden hose to that connector. A cheap garden hose is probably best. They are smaller in diameter, and will fit the water inlet valves better. Cut off the other end of the hose to shorten the hose and to remove the metal or plastic connector at that end. If the hose is narrow enough, it might fit the water inlet valves on the machine. If not, it will still be a lot more convenient than using a bucket to fill the machine.",

        "content": "My husband and I bought this washing machine after discovering that our new home (in an apartment building) didn't have a convenient laundry room, after all.\n\nThat left my husband and me with two choices: Trek to the laundromat weekly, giving up time we'd rather use for fun activities, or find a way to wash our most frequently used clothes at home.\n\nAfter reading LOTS of reviews, we decided to try this washing machine, and I'm SO glad we did!\n\nThe first thing to know is: You'll learn a LOT by reading others' reviews of this washer. I recommend filtering the reviews by looking for reviews featuring the word \"lint.\" They tend to include the most information.\n\nThen, here are my best tips and insights to get the most from this wonderful washer...\n\nFor us, it makes the most sense to use this washing machine in our bathroom. We've put ours on an old coffee table, so the washer is at a comfortable height and near the tub/shower combo, and we don't have to move it in & out of the tub, or anything like that.\n\nHowever, the spin/dry cycle can be noisy sometimes, so we've put anti-vibration pads under the legs of the washer AND under the legs of the coffee table. (Recommended: MyLifeUNIT Shock Absorbing Washer Pads, Anti-Vibration Washer Mat Protector for Washing Machine Dryer Treadmill )\n\nAlso, I was not impressed with the hose intended to fill the washer through one of the water inlets. So, I inserted that hose into the larger hose (used to drain the water into a sink or - in our case - into the tub), and hot glued a ring around the outside of the hose where the two join. That added length makes draining the water super-easy.\n\n(In nearly two months of steady use, I've only had to reinforce that connection once, and only in a tiny spot.)\n\nIn addition, we put a nylon sock - intended to hold a bar of soap in the shower - over the end of the drainage hose combo, so our tub's drain doesn't get clogged with lint. Initially, there was a LOT of lint coming off our socks and knit clothing.\n\nFor most loads, I fill the washing machine tub about half full. That seems to work best to get everyday dirt out of fabrics.\n\nThen, I add water to the washer with our hand-held shower head, noting that the water shouldn't be super hot in this washing machine. (Note: There is a drain near the top of it, so the water won't accidentally overflow.)\n\nI turn the washing machine on, and - as the clothes are moving back and forth - add laundry detergent. Use less than you expect to need. A little goes a very long way.\n\n(Biggest surprise: Seeing how much dirt came out of our clothes during the first couple of washings. Apparently, the washing machine in our old apartment was NOT doing a very good job. I LOVE how clean our clothes are, now.)\n\nLike another reviewer suggested, I sometimes wash the clothes for the longest time (15 minutes), let the clothes sit (in the same water) for about 20 minutes, and then run it - in the same water - through another wash cycle. If the clothes are extra-dirty, that extra wash cycle really helps.\n\nThen, I remove the clothes, wringing them out, lightly, and place them in the spin dryer. (And, of course, drain the water from the washing tub.)\n\nTip: Fill the spin dryer halfway, at the most, and try to balance the weight of the items evenly. Jam the white plastic grid down firmly, and then turn the spin cycle on for just a few seconds.\n\n- If the spin cycle makes terrible clunking noises, stop the spin cycle immediately. Readjust the clothes (or remove a couple of heavy items) and try again.\n\n- If it makes just a few rocking noises, wait and see if it balances itself. If not, readjust the clothes and try again.\n\nOnce you're sure the load is well-balanced, dial the spin cycle to 1, 2, or 3. More than that doesn't seem to make much difference. Generally, I'm happy with 1 for this part of the process. (Note: Each dial can be reset to a longer time, but if you change your mind and want to dial it down to a shorter time... that doesn't seem to work. So, start with a cycle that's shorter than you think you may need.)\n\nThen the clothes go back into the washer for a rinse cycle, followed by another spin-dry cycle before we hang the clothes on a drying rack. (For this spin cycle, I often dial it up to 3 minutes, to get the clothes as dry as possible.)\n\nWe've been using this washer three or four times a week, for about two months. I'll admit that this is time-consuming, and a little annoying to shuffle the clothes back and forth between the washing side of the machine and the spin dryer.\n\nBut compared with having to buy more clothes or spend hours more at a laundromat... I'm delighted to use this washer.\n\nIt's holding up well. Everything is still working like new. Our clothes seem to be cleaner than ever.\n\nThe only disappointment has been trying to wash heavy clothes like denim jeans, etc. Though the washing machine seems to get them clean, the spin dryer balks at a super-heavy load like that. And I don't have the patience to keep readjusting the load to keep the machine from rocking.\n\nOther reviewers say they're washing jeans in this machine, but for me, it makes the most sense to save the heaviest clothes for a single trip to the laundromat every few weeks.\n\nIf you're looking for a small, affordable washing machine for your apartment or RV, this is the machine to get. I give it a full five stars for providing excellent value and convenience. And, as I said earlier, our clothes have never been cleaner.",

        "content": " This was a great purchase for me and my fiancé. We washed everything including sheets and towels. The only trick is figuring out how much you can put in at one time without overloading the machine. The one thing that I say is a hassle is the spinner and that’s because you really have to balance the clothes perfectly so it doesn’t knock knock knock and sound like it’s gonna break. But other than that once you’ve got the clothes in there the way the machine likes it It’s a real gem.\n\nWe have a small apartment and this fits in our small bathroom just fine. We love the convenience. It takes maybe 20 minutes to do the whole wash and spin cycle. Then we just hang up the clothes right in the shower and put a fan on and within just a little bit of time our clothes are smelling fresh air clean and dry. A lot goes to the spin cycle because it really does a great job getting all the water out.\n\nWhen we first got this in the box we were really excited it was put together so no assembly needed we just plugged it in and started washing clothes right away. We didn’t have to read any instructions it was pretty straightforward.\n\nWe tried a few different ways to wash the clothes with the different cycles they have. Like on our clothes that we don’t want to be roughed up too much we use the soft cycle. It’s also got set a 15 minute timer to wash the clothes which we do a load with the minimum detergent because we realized if used to much the clothes get really stiff. And sometimes if that happens where we put too much detergent will just wash it the first time drain all the water out and then put water back in and do another cycle and then drain it so that it gets more soap out. We also decided to start using softener and that helped With the stiffness we incurred a lot too.\n\nWe also would make the suggestion that when you get this machine you put it on some thing, we used milk crates. Just two of them and I guess that’s pretty much how you can visualize how big the machine actually will be. Honestly it doesn’t fit on the whole two milk crates but about 1 1/2. We have it up on the milk crates because we had to run the hose differently because it didn’t fit on our faucet. So since we don’t attach it to the sink or the faucet we fill up a bucket and it usually takes three buckets to put in the washer for a big load.\n\nUsually we can wash like six shirts and two pairs of pants and all of our undergarments in one load. It takes about five loads though to spin them because you want to put it in exactly balanced otherwise you have to keep shutting it off and re-organizing the load so putting in like maybe two shirts and a pair of pants or all your undergarments at one time or just maybe a few T-shirts at one time and one pair of jeans sometimes I’ve done that put just one pair of pants in so that it doesn’t knock or unbalance and it gets done in the five minutes just right. It’s easy for my fiancé to use to we both can do our little lot loads every day if we want to.\n\nWe don’t pay for water so I can’t tell you what the water bill would be as far as an increase but it doesn’t take much more than a shower would if even more water than one does at all.\n\nIt literally was the best investment it’s better than going down to the laundry mat paying for an Uber to get there paying $10 for a load of laundry and wash and dry pretty much we saved all that we would’ve spent on this washing machine in the past three months alone it has paid for itself for sure. My suggestion is if you got a small place and it’s just you and another person this is great.\n\nI wouldn’t use it for more than two people though just because that’s a lot of standing around waiting for it to wash and dry and hang when you could just go to the laundromat and get it done if it’s that many people with that many clothes. If you stay up on it it doesn’t get out of hand.\n\nI really can only wash two towels at a time but I can only dry one by itself and our towels are the large kind of towels. Meaning they’re pretty much bigger than the standard towel.\n\nWhen it comes to noise this is Machine is super quiet. The only time is loud and I mean super loud like it’s going to blow up is when you put the clothes once again in the wrong way on the spin sideAnd you’ll know immediately if it’s unbalanced trust me. It’s a simple fix but it is loud.\nIt’s not too big and it’s not too small… it’s just right.",

        "content": "TLDR:\nPro: affordable, compact, decent load size\nCons: more time consuming than traditional washer, awkward hosing connections, may require some handyman skills\n\nThis is not a full sized washing machine. It will not perform the same. It does not offer the same level of convenience. That's ok, I'm not comparing this to a full size washing; In my head I'm comparing it to doing all my laundry at a laundromat.\n\nI'm a single person who found myself renting a house without a washer and dryer for the first time in my life. Knowing I would move again in a year and not wanting to deal with the hassel of a full sized washer and dryer (also being incredibly cheap) a portable washing machine seemed like a good enough idea.\n\nFor price comparison I see used washing machines (that the seller states work) listed on facebook marketplace for around $100-200. National average for a laundromat is $6 a load so roughly $36 a month for me (maybe less if I stop sorting my laundry). Renting a washing machine from rent a center is like $60ish/month. So from a price standpoint, at $150 this device is priced very fair.\n\nNow onto the machine itself. The directions are ok, but it is a learning curve. Part of that learning curve is I just had no idea how much goes on inside a washing machine normally. Essentially you are doing a bunch of steps that would normally be automated manually. You don't just get to set it and forget it. You manually fill the machine with water (which has the added benefit of giving you a lot of control over water volume and temperature). You then have to manually progress your clothes through all the stages of being washed. The user manual recommends the following steps for washing clothes: wash; spin; rinse; spin. I personally have just been doing wash, rinse, spin and found my clothes get clean without detergent residue ( I then hang dry my clothes in case you're curious). I also put mine on a box because I use it in the bathroom and the drain hose works better if it is flat or elevated to the thing youre draining into (a very a-duh thing but there was some wishful thinking on my part at one point).\n\nAs far as capacity inside the washing portion I can fit a full sized fitted sheet, full sized flat sheet, and two pillow cases no problem. It is and will always be annoying that the spin half is smaller than the washing half. But I realize the alternative is building a bigger machine which would be counter to my goal of having a small portable machine.\n\nThere are a couple other things I wish were different. I also wish the hoses were longer. I realize that this machine was designed for small spaces and so I actually don't consider a design flaw that the hoses are on the shorter end but it is inconvenient for me none the less. The sink hose also does not attach well to my faucet. I can get it on but I have to stand there and hold it. This really sucks because based on how my bathroom is set up and how the hoses and outlet come out I can't really see into the machine as it is filling. But it is honestly a plastic hose and I am confident I can find a remedy at a hardware store.\n\nAnother thing, when I first opened the box it would turn on but not wash. Following the user guide one of the trouble shooting tips is to tighten some bolts inside the machine. Its a little confusing because there are no pictures in the user manual to better explain this, but on the back of the machine there is a panel. If you unscrew the three bolts at the bottom you can then remove the panel. You can now see inside your machine and should see (on your left) the device for rinsing and (on your right) the device washing (it will have a belt). There were some bolts that helped connect these devices to their respective bins above. The bolts didn't feel loose, but I loosened them and tightened them and suddenly everything worked so I have no other explanation. Unplug the machine before you do this unless you liked getting shocked (this is not speaking from experience just a rudimentary understanding of electricity). I did message the company while I was still trying to fix this issue and they responded within 24hrs which is always a nice touch, though I had fixed it by then.\n\nAll in all this device accomplishes what I want it do, which is wash my clothes in an affordable way that does involve me becoming responsible for a heavy piece of machinery. If you're washing clothes for a family of five this is probably not for you as it would make washing a near full time job (I assume, again I am very much single). But if you wanted to do a few loads a week for your family in your RV, yeah this can do this. If you're a single, cheapskate millennial like me this may also work for you.",

        "content": "Great little machine, do not over load it, Works great for the money! You can wash and spin at the same time.\n\nYou just have to lower or use the drain hose and do not switch the Selection knob to drain. Keep it on standard. Move your water hose over to rinse side and set timer and allow spin basket to adjust. Do not continue if the basket is off balance. Stop machine immediately and adjust the clothes. Turn the timer off! This usually works after one adjustment. Example towels I did one at time and just pour the towel into spin basket Loosely and then place the spinner guard on top. Do not smash down and then turn on timer. Once water hose is hooked up and timer is on ans basket is balance and the spinner reaches high speed turn on water and let it rinse for about 30-45 second and turn water off and then repeat as needed. I did this twice and clothes came out fine.\n\nSpinner doesn’t do well with constantly adding rinse water. Just short burst of water and then repeat. I do two burst of Water for the rinse in the spinner side. Then reset timer for full 5 min. Clothes come out close to dry. Will not dry clothes completely. Most clothes will dry on hanging rack or hanging within 1 hour or so.\n\nRinse and spin works great to remove detergent. Wished it came with longer drain hose! Great for small living spaces. Not very loud at all. Washes clothes and gets them clean!\n\nMachine will get hot if used for back to back loads. Recommend that you only use it for no more than 3 loads on the 15 min wash cycle. I’ve used it for 4 loads and seems to get really hot at the base where the motor is located.\n\nI set my machine up on sturdy folding table and used non slip grip pad to help hold machine in place Set 5 gallon buck along side to drain water out and just empty bucket after draining the water from the washer and then replace empty bucket back for use on the spin side.\n\nWashing small loads daily or every other day has saved me trips to the laundromat.\n\nThis machine is perfect for washing children’s clothes. I have a 2 year old who spills or get clothes soiled and it works great to set it up and wash his clothes before stains set in.\n\nTip 1. Don’t use a lot of liquid detergent as the machine makes great use of small amount of soap\n\nTip 2. If washing clothes that aren’t too soiled you can Simply pull the clothes out and move them to the spin side and rinse with water and keep the wash water and use for 2nd load to save on water and soap. Example wash lightly soiled clothes and then wash whites and add small amount of bleach just about and an ounce or so to wash water and add little bit more water and your good to go for the second load. Your saving water and soap\n\nOverall very satisfied with this purchase for the money. I feel the machine could be made a little better but over all very satisfied.\n\nWith the rising cost of gas and travel to the laundromat. The machine should pay for itself in short amount of time.",

        "content": "This is my personal use case. You may have a different situation, you may have exactly what I do. My purchase was spurred by a desire to have a washing machine in my apartment after being displaced from a home with a washer and dryer.\n\nFirst off, it beats handwashing or scouring the town for a place to get quarters. I have the machine in my bathroom. I leave it outside the tub when storing, and in the tub when using. If you can lift a full clothes hamper to put in the car and run down to the laundromat, then you can lift this. This machine has done boxers and socks, a week of shirts, a couple bath towels and dish towels, and properly done one pair of jeans at a time. The best way to handle most loads is to do a wash load in the wash side, drain, do the same load with fabric softener, drain, spin half, spin the other half. The spin bucket will definitely jump if it's off-balance. Stop the spin, re-seat the clothes, try again. Once it finishes, hang clothes on hangers to dry. (I say one pair of jeans properly because I could not get the agitator to actually move two pairs around in the tub. Better to do one clean and take a little longer than to shove them in and have them come out dirty. No point in that, best to do it right.)\n\nThis is not a massive miracle washer, nor will it spin things completely dry in most cases, especially for jeans. I have intentions on getting a low power front-loading dryer or hanging fan dryer to complement it, especially for the jeans. But, my clothes get clean, and I can even watch the water as it drains to see exactly how clean. Little weird thing, I know, but it does something for me.\n\nI could say there are more convenient products out here, but they will cost you more and are physically heavier. This does the job just fine and fits my needs and purposes perfectly. When it's laundry day, you do the work, but you don't have to run out to do it. Suits me fine.",

        "content": "This little machine is good. But before I talk about it specifically, there are some things you should really consider. Do you plan to make this your main way of doing laundry? Because you'll have to be ready to live the portable laundry lifestyle and it may be a lifestyle change.\n\nWe got this machine because our new greedy landlords decided to knock down our laundry room to make way for a couple more apartments. Yeah, thanks for putting in the humanity touch in the COVID pandemic. And yes, while they are monkey turds and I hope they one day find themselves in a desert with their only hope of survival being the shelter of a lizard's buttcrack, this review is not about them.\n\nYou will most likely have to spread your laundry over 3 days or every other day unless you buy a dryer too. The spin does wonders and it is impressive how much water it gets out, but only synthetics will come out close to dry. Cotton t-shirts may dry over night and cotton pants, well that might be more like 24 hours. So you'll need to hang a lot of your clothing up to finish drying and unless you have a lot of room and hangers, you won't be able to do it all in one night. This is part of why it is a lifestyle change.\n\nAnother thing to consider is where will you put this? Luckily, we have 2 bathrooms. But I like having both showers accessible. I put mine on a $5 Ikea table and move it by the bathtub when i use it. If you have only one bathroom, would you want to really move it around every time to do laundry? Some people put it near their kitchen sink to drain. I could see some drains having problems keeping up with the amount of water coming out at a time. If you do have another bathtub, it might work to just leave it there. It depends. The hose is only about a foot and a half long. And it is on the left and doesn't look like I can flip it to the right (I could be wrong). And the hose is not flexible. It only bends left and right. Depending on the tub, having a hose in one direction may not work so well.\n\nAs for the machine itself, I have to split my usual weekly clothing into 3-4 loads. I fill it with a bucket. It does a great job cleaning. I was shocked how much dirt and soap came out in the first couple washes...honestly, I now question what the commercial washers we had access to were doing and I barely put the amount of soap you'd think you should, otherwise, you'll be doing 50 rinse cycles. The spin holds about half the clothing as the washing tub. You will have to babysit the spin cycle, because that can make it rattle and move around. The good news is, I have found no real advantage to spinning more than a minute at a time. Barely any more water comes out after that.\n\nAs good as it is, we will have to go to the laundromat for comforters and heavy blankets. Those won't fit, but we can get away with a sheet at a time.\n\nLuckily a few users put instructions here (including one good video around 10 min) because the manual has very little. I wish it had an obvious line that says you shouldn't fill it any higher. There's an indentation in the tub, but I do not know if that is a design or meant to say you're overloading it if you go beyond that.\n\nWe just received a Panda dryer too, and I will review that after using it a couple weeks, but really consider getting some sort of dryer with this if you have the space.",

        "content": "This product is excellent if you have a very clear understanding of what it is capable of and base your expectations accordingly. Read reviews! I’ve had it for about 10 days and used it almost daily, and this is what I would have wanted to know before buying it:\n\n1. This machine is not one that you can run and leave unattended. It requires frequent attention since you have to manually switch items from the wash/rinse side to the spin side.\n\n2. That being said, the spin side is much smaller than the wash side. I do 2-3 rounds of spinning depending on how many clothes I put in the wash side at once. You will need to wash, spin, rinse then spin again. The spin cycle does a good job of getting stuff mostly dry if you make sure not to overfill it. IT DOES NOT DRY THINGS COMPLETELY! You will still need to hang things to dry, which doesn’t bother me since it extends the life of your clothes anyways.\n\n3. If you have a shower head with a hose, use that to fill the wash side! The mashing comes with a hose that you attach to a faucet/water input and then the other end attaches to the machine. I had a shower head that I was unscrewing every time to get the hose to fit, which is fine but a bit annoying. The hose that comes with the machine may fit your sink though!\n\n4. This is a tip more than anything: wash small items (socks, underwear, etc)/delicates in a garment bag. A couple of my tee shirts got snagged and got holes in them (learned this lesson early before I did any clothes I care about too much!) so if you are worried about that either spin less clothes at once or use a garment bag. Additionally, a couple of socks fell through while spinning and to take them out I had to undo the screws to the top of the machine and fish them out.\n\n5. This machine really is meant for clothes. Bulkier items like towels can be done, but will need to be spun individually. For me it is either this machine or a laundromat, so I personally don’t mind spending a bit more time switching things back and forth.\n\n6. It is very light! Lighter than you would expect, so fairly easy to use. I carry it to the bathroom when I want to do laundry, and otherwise it lives in the closet. I just make sure to hang the water hose in the shower so it dries/doesn’t get moldy and leave the doors to the wash and spin side open for the same reason.",

        "content": "Been using this Zeny portable mini washer for 2 months. First, it gets out dirt you didn't even know was there, I'm amazed at how dirty clothes I'd washed at the laundromat were, so gross. This little machine has shown me not to do laundry there anymore!\nIt only washes a few things at a time, which is a bit of a bummer, but it's cleans, with a little soap, just don't overload it for obvious reasons.\nI have forgotten about it twice and overfilled it, the entire machine to the top in both sides, it didn't even leak and still worked fine.(after I let the extra water out)\nSome people say they can't see the fill line, I don't understand why, there's clearly a raised line inside the back of the wash tub.\nThe \"dryer\" is a spinner that's all, it doesn't dry just spins out water, like a big washer only in a separate tub. It goes off balance, you adjust the load, the most anoying thing about it the machine is the sound it makes when it's off balance.\nIt's not \"automatic\" I forget about it and that slows the process down. (My fault, not the machines)\nOverall, it's a very handy little machine, it has a bit of a learning curve, but it's good to learn new stuff!\nBottom line,it cleans. I would buy it again.",

        "content": "This is a review and comparison of two different products:\nFeramox Invisible Ring Size Adjuster, assorted sizes (this product), and the Vancool (18pcs) Ring Size Adjuster (1.5mm/2mm/3mm) (https://amazon.com/gp/product/B073J4X9DH).\n\nI have several rings that were a little too loose and kept spinning around on my finger. I didn’t want to have them resized, because then they’d be too tight to go over my knuckle, so I decided to try some ring sizer products to see how well they worked.\n\nBottom line: Overall I prefer the Feramox insert-type adjusters to the Vancool coil-type adjusters because of the look and comfort, but it all depends on your preference. Either type can be put in place after the ring is on your finger, so you don’t have to worry about getting the ring over your knuckle. The biggest drawbacks to the Feramox ones are that they may fall off and get lost if you don’t use the adhesive (and maybe even if you do), and you may only be able to use one size out of the package for a particular ring. The coil-type has the advantage of allowing you to adjust the ring size a little better by using thicker or thinner coils, and they won’t fall off.\n\nDetailed comparison:\nThe Feramox adjusters, which were sold by “Freeman Direct”, come in a package of 8 in various sizes, to fit band widths from 1mm to 10mm. (They also sell packages for wider widths, so be careful what you order. If you are looking for sizers for thin rings like solitaires, this is the one you need.) Also included in the package are a silver polishing cloth and a sheet of adhesive. Unfortunately, the product information sheet comes attached to the adhesive sheet, so I didn’t realize what it was at first. There was a blue-green card that had the Feramox product information on one side, and a yellow backing on the other. The yellow backing was actually the backing for the adhesive tape sheet. I had to peel the Feramox card off it, which revealed the instructions for using the tape on the other side. The tape has a transparent film on one side, and the yellow paper sheet on the other. When you pull them apart, be sure to peel the Feramox card off, leaving the transparent film attached to the yellow sheet. Do not peel off the yellow sheet. If you choose to use the adhesive, cut a sliver of the tape to fit inside the groove in the ring adjuster. Peel off the yellow paper and attach the adhesive to the adjuster, then peel off the transparent film. I will probably not use the tape, because with the sizer stuck onto the band, I probably wouldn’t be able to fit the ring over my knuckle. Instead, I’m going to try wearing it by just slipping the sizer in place after the ring is on my finger. I’ll have to be careful not to lose it when removing the rings, but I think it will probably work out better for me, and none of the rings I’ll use it with will get daily wear.\n\nI found one sizer that perfectly snapped onto a 5.7mm gold band. The smallest sizer snapped onto a ring that was 2.16mm wide and stayed on. For the rings that are 1.25mm and 1.83mm, the smallest sizer wouldn’t stay on the ring by itself, but it seems to work okay on them if I slide them on once the ring is on my finger.\n\nOnce in place, they’re virtually unnoticeable. The sizer is barely visible when looking at the palm side of my hand, and I don’t feel anything unusual except that the ring just feels a little thicker. It works great to keep the stone on the top of my finger where it should be, instead of sliding around.\n\nUnfortunately, you have to purchase a package of 8 different sizes, when you might only need one or two of the sizes. I wish they had packages of just one particular size, then I wouldn’t worry about losing one. On the other hand, I was able to use 3 of the sizes in this package, and since I’m not going to use the tape to stick them on the rings, I can move the smallest one between the rings that need it. You can use a sizer that’s a little wider than the band, so the two smallest sizes both worked for 3 different ring sizes.\n\nOne other thing to note: When trying to get the rings on/off my finger with the insert in place, I found it a little more difficult than when using the coil type. Maybe it’s because the coil rolls around the ring, and helps the ring sort of roll over your finger. So if you do tape the insert in place, that might be an issue.\n\nVancool Adjusters: This product was sold by “Nest My Life”. It comes with 18 adjusters (6 each of 1.5mm, 2mm, and 3mm coils, and also includes a polishing cloth. The adjusters are easy to use, just coil the desired size around the ring and cut it to desired length. I looked at a lot of similar products, but purchased this one because it included the smallest coils (down to 1.5mm). Most other packages did not come in a size less than 3mm. On a thin ring, the smaller coils look much better.\n\nThe advantages of the coil adjusters are that you can use whichever thickness provides the best adjustment, and you don’t have to worry about them falling off the ring. You get so many of them, and only need a small piece for each ring, that it’s not a big deal if you need to replace them. Since the coils wrap around the ring, you don’t have to worry about them falling off. I also found that rings with the coil adjuster were easier to slide over my knuckle than rings with the insert adjuster, because the coils rolled and helped the ring move. But if you do have a problem getting the ring over your knuckle, it’s possible to put the coil on while the ring is on your finger.\n\nThe downside is that they’re much more visible than the inserts, and are a little less comfortable. They also seem to slide around on the ring, which wasn’t a problem with the inserts.",

        "content": "I had two signet rings which were maybe 1/2 size too large to fit comfortably. Especially when my hands got cold, they would rotate to one side or the other, or slide down onto my knuckle. These adjusters are made of a slightly flexible plastic. They simply snap into place on the inside of the lower part of the ring, occupying about 1/4 of the inner circle, and effectively make the ring fit just a little bit more snugly.\nAs far as comfort goes, I can't feel them when wearing the rings. The only way I know they are there at all is that the rings fit better than before. They are made of a very transparent plastic material, so not easy to see even if looking at the bottom side of the ring, and completely undetectable when looking from the top. Since the plastic material is softer than any metal used in jewelry, I can't imagine how they could possibly damage a ring. If you do anything that gets your hands dirty while wearing the ring, some of the dirt may get trapped under the adjuster, and be visible since it's transparent. If this happens, it's easy to remove the adjuster, clean the dirt out, and reinstall the adjuster.\nThe package contains one of each of the listed sizes, so you will end up with a bunch of leftover sizes that you probably don't need. As it turned out, I used two out of the package, for two separate rings that had different widths. The rest are redundant for the moment, unless my fingers somehow become more slender, or someone else in my family happens to need one.\nAt first there was a very strong plastic smell that I could notice any time my hand was near my face. It was fairly intense and unpleasant, and although I didn't have any allergic reaction on my finger (no rash or itching, no discomfort), some sensitive people might. The smell lessened, and eventually went away after a number of weeks wearing and washing my hands with the rings on. I suppose someone could leave the ring in a dish of warm soapy water for a while if they didn't want to wear the ring with it smelling so strongly.\nOverall, the adjuster does exactly what it claims. The two that I used both fit properly and improved the fit of the rings that I used them on. They are almost invisible in use. The cost seems kind of high even if I used every single one in the bag, but if I consider that it made two rings wearable that hadn't really been wearable before, then the expense seems a bit more reasonable and certainly easier and cheaper than having rings resized by a jeweler.",

        "content": "I was on the fence about buying this but it is the perfect solution to a big ring! We sent my engagement ring to be resized but it came back and was still falling off my finger. I don’t know if it’s because it’s February and it’s cold (how cold can it really be in FL) or what, but I didn’t want to have send it to be resized a second time and risk it coming back too tight. I found this adjuster and its honestly a lifesaver. I can’t even tell it’s on, and my ring feels so secure. My band is VERY thin (1.8 or 1.5mm, can’t remember exactly) so that was my only concern but the 2 smallest adjusters fit perfectly, I use the second to smallest because that made the ring just a little tighter.

        "content": "I have had this for three years! I definitely recommend either to reduce trips to the laundromat, or in addition to one's regular washer to wash cloth diapers, cleaning rags, sandy beach clothes, stinky stuff, cuddle toys, or delicates. Bought one for my mom at the same time, which recently died. Ours still works. Uses a lot of water, but uses very little detergent. Spinner works better than any full size washer's spinner cycle that I've used, helping clothes dry quickly when hung up. The washer only drains when the dial is placed on drain, but the spinner drains continually so items can be spun while washing or while draining the washer. Use liquid fabric softener so clothes dry soft, without air-dry stiffness. Using a rubber band, attach a sock or pantyhose to the drain hose to catch lint.\n\nLoad capacity: Works best with two pairs of teen or adult sized jeans along with a handful of other clothes, or a couple of sheets, or two to three bath towels, or a small blanket, or a single pillow; basically, if you can fit it in the spinner or in a standard grocery bag, it'll wash well in this tub. Though it can wash twice as much, dividing the load in half to spin, I find that the clothes agitate easily and thus they clean best if washing just what fits in the spinner.\n\nDetergent, fabric softener, and deodorizers/laundry boosters: Just put in a little! A tablespoon full or two (or a little medicine cup full, or just a quick dash) of detergent works great, along with that much fabric softener. I use Gain and Downey, and put them in simultaneously instead of doing separate loads. For heavily soiled items, stinky stuff, wet stuff that sat awhile, peed on stuff, etc, just rinse in the spinner until the water is clear, then wash a couple of times with a deodorizer or laundry booster. I like to use Odoban for the bad stuff, or a bit of Washing Soda and a bit of Oxy Clean along with a dash of Gain. Note: Use fabric softener! Jeans, towels, socks, etc will air dry without stiffness, and all clothes will air dry and feel good to the touch if using softener.\n\nWashing and drying process: I just wash, and rinse while spinning in the spinner, then let it spin for a couple more minutes. For more heavily soiled clothes or stinky clothes, I'd repeat the cycle. I used to wash, spin, then put it back in the washing tub for a couple of clean-water rinse cycles, but now I prefer just using a bucket of water at a time as it spins, or attaching a hose, to rinse until clear and not bubbly. Here is step by step for various types of loads:\n\nVery lightly soiled loads, delicates, cuddle toys: Wash once in washer, then rinse while spinning in spinner. 1) I wash once, with three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent and a little softener for nine minutes or so. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. 2) I spin the load for two minutes, then remove the clothes. 3) I place one pair of jeans or another heavy item that absorbs lots of water easily back into the spinner one at a time, or half a spinner full of regular stuff. If only half full or less, I do not bother with the cap that stops clothes from jumping up and over the edge while spinning. I pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three buckets per pair of jeans plus three buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about three minutes, but it might take another bucket of water. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires about three to four minutes of water flow (the connector is small) plus three minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 4) Place everything on hangers, using clothes pins or clips for smaller items, and hang a few inches apart in doorways or, even better, on a line running across the room. For cuddle toys or pillows, place in front of a fan for a few hours, then flip for a few more hours. If the air isn't humid and if the window is open or the fan is on, everything should dry in a couple of hours. If it has been raining or it is otherwise humid, just have a fan on and leave it for several hours, while at work, or over night and everything will dry well.\n\nModerately soiled or stinky loads: Wash once with detergent and laundry booster, spin or rinse and spin, wash with detergent and softener, then rinse while spinning: 1) Decide whether or not you want to rinse until water runs clear before your first wash. If so, fill the spinner no more than half full, and do not bother with the cap unless you fear socks will jump out. Then, pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then repeat, continuing until the water is pretty clear; usually, two or three buckets is enough, followed by two minutes or so spin time. Alternatively, attach a hose to the hose connector and similarly allow water to flow in until it runs clear, letting it spin for two minutes or so after turning off the water 2) First of two washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent and a little softener for nine to fifteen minutes. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. If you want, add a cup of Odoban or a couple tablespoons or so each of Washing Soda and OxyClean. 3) I spin the load for two minutes, then return the clothes to the washer. If I used Washing Soda + OxyClean, I let it spin for a two minutes, pour in one bucket of water, then let it spin for two minutes again. You may want a second bucket if the water is especially dark, because these cause clothes to bleed though they clean very well. 4) Second of two washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent and a little softener for nine minutes or so. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. 5) I spin the load for two minutes, then remove the clothes. 6) I place one pair of jeans or another heavy item that absorbs lots of water easily back into the spinner one at a time, or half a spinner full of regular stuff. If only half full or less, I do not bother with the cap that stops clothes from jumping up and over the edge while spinning. I pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three buckets per pair of jeans plus three buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about three minutes, but it might take another bucket of water. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires about three to four minutes of water flow (the connector is small) plus three minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 7) Place everything on hangers, using clothes pins or clips for smaller items, and hang a few inches apart in doorways or, even better, on a line running across the room. If the air isn't humid and if the window is open or the fan is on, everything should dry in a couple of hours. If it has been raining or it is otherwise humid, just have a fan on and leave it for several hours, while at work, or over night and everything will dry well.\n\nFor heavily soiled, peed on, or truly stinky loads: Rinse, wash lightly with detergent and laundry booster just to loosen yuckies, rinse while spinning, wash or wash and soak with detergent and laundry booster, rinse while spinning, wash with detergent and softener, then rinse while spinning. 1) Rinse in the spinner until water runs clear; works easiest if spinner is no more than half full. Pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three to six buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about two minutes. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires probably five minutes of water flow as it spins (the connector is small) plus two minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 2) First of three washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket), a little detergent, and a cup of Odoban or a little Washing Soda + OxyClean for five minutes, to loosen up the dirt and yuckies. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, filling anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line. Drain, but do not spin the clothes if they're especially yucky and you do not want to touch them unnecessarily. 3) First of three rinses: Decide whether or not to spin and rinse, or simply rinse in the washing side before washing a second time. If spinning and rinsing, use about three buckets of water per half spinner full, by pouring in a bucket and letting it spin while refilling the bucket, then doing so again until the water runs clear. I have also used a hose from the shower or sink, until the water runs clear, then allowing two minutes of spin time. If you do not want to touch truly yucky clothes more than necessary, leave them in the washer, and pour a bucket of water directly into the washer while allowing it to drain right out. Once drained, pour in another bucket, or simply saturate with water for a minute from a hose. Then fill the washer, let it wash (without adding detergents or anything) for a couple of minutes to loosen yuckies, and drain again. 4) Second of three washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket) or filling with a hose anywhere between the lint catcher and the max fill line, add a little detergent, and a cup of Odoban or a little Washing Soda + OxyClean for fifteen minutes. Decide whether or not to leave it soaking for a few hours or overnight; if so, be sure to wash for a couple of minutes before draining. 5) Second of three rinses; I spin the load for two minutes, then pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, doing so for about three to six buckets until the water runs clear; alternatively, I use a hose to continually rinse the clothes until the water runs clear, then continue to spin for two minutes. 6) Third of three washes: With three buckets of water (2 or 2 and a half gallon typical size bucket) or filling with a hose, add a little detergent and a little softener for nine minutes or so. 7) Third of three rinses: I spin the load for two minutes, then remove the clothes. 8) I place one pair of jeans or another heavy item that absorbs lots of water easily back into the spinner one at a time, or half a spinner full of regular stuff. If only half full or less, I do not bother with the cap that stops clothes from jumping up and over the edge while spinning. I pour in a bucket of water and let it spin while refilling the bucket, then pour in another bucket and let it spin, then pour in another bucket and let it spin. It usually takes three buckets per pair of jeans plus three buckets per half load, with the final spin time of about three minutes, but it might take another bucket of water. Alternatively, attach a hose to the connector above the spinner, and let water continually run in while on spin; this requires about three to four minutes of water flow (the connector is small) plus three minutes of spin time once the water is off. Basically, rinse until the water is clear, then spin for a couple of minutes. 9) Place everything on hangers, using clothes pins or clips for smaller items, and hang a few inches apart in doorways or, even better, on a line running across the room. If the air isn't humid and if the window is open or the fan is on, everything should dry in a couple of hours. If it has been raining or it is otherwise humid, just have a fan on and leave it for several hours, while at work, or over night and everything will dry well. 10) After drying, does it still stink once it dries? Wash with Odoban or a bit of Washing Soda and OxyClean, then let it soak all day or overnight. Do the typical wash with detergent and booster additives-rinse and spin-wash with just detergent and softener-rinse and spin. If it dries and still stinks, toss it in the trash.",

        "content": "Update: I have had this for a couple weeks now and figured out some \"hacks\" and tips.\n\nI place this in my tub and found no issue with that. I use our bathroom sponge to balance the machine and ease vibrations. I also went to my hardware store and bought a showerhead diverter, a 30-in 1/2\" faucet supply hose, and a brass \"barbed\" adaptor. *Ensure these all connect in the store before purchase!* Sadly, 8 forgot the hose that came with the package, but I zip-tied it a couple times to get a decent seal. I always leave a little slack so any stray leaks don't get on the machine. Makes life easier just turning on the shower and filling/rinsing the machine this way. Cost of this was $30 but worth it! I am a 6'5\" guy and I threw my back out filling the machine over and over. Plus, you can do a rinse and spin to get the suds out.\n\nWith this machine, you must always think \"less is more\" and if it looks like enough, it's already too much. A decent load, to measure, is whatever can fit in the spin basket plus a one extra, light thing. When the wash cycle is going, you want to see a vortex... a whirlpool effect. If your clothes are floating and spinning at the top struggling to be washed, you've overloaded. Pull out items one by one until you get that whirlpool.\n\nYou can spin and wash at the same time. The spinner drains regardless of the middle knob is set to drain, and if you overfill the wash tub it will drain whatever overflows. Plan this accordingly.\n\nNoise is compareble to an AC unit, and there are vibrations depending on where you place it and how level it is. I use a sponge balance and absorb some vibrations. Not fancy, but works.\n\nI reuse my hot water, topping off the wash tub each time. The water may look gross but it's fine as there's soap already in it. Dry cleaners reuse their chemical wash hundreds of times over and your clothes come out fine, plus you'll rinse it all. My whites come out whiter than the commercial washers too, so you're saving money and resources.\n\nI'm still very happy!\n\n***\n\nWhere do I start? Well, I have spent a good portion of the few weeks looking at portable washing solutions as my apartment does not have a washer set-up, and I got tired of using the public washers in my apartment community. All the coins needed, going back and forth, waiting for machines to open, ensuring I had enough quarters at the time, and the entire day had to be devoted to laundry more often than not.\n\nSo, I shopped around, reading reviews and watching videos of different machines. This one stuck out as it's reasonably affordable and does a great job, according to reviews. I live in the Bay Area and this ships for Los Angeles, so I got it within a couple days (excluding a holiday and weekend). The box was in good shape and unclipped the ties. A whiff of \"new plastic\" and staring in awe, there it was, just as in the pictures. Unboxing was easy, unclip the ties and lift the top part off. A brand-new washer!\n\nI grabbed the instruction manual and flipped through it. As other have joked on here, it's in Engrish with such gems as \"choke the dial\" and \"put staff not under.\" I tossed it aside because it's useless, most reviews give you the rundown. Here's mine, if you need it:\n\nStep 1: Place a splash of soap, no more than a heaping tablespoon's worth or the soap will take forever to rinse out. You don't need to measure, but just guess and be cautious.\nStep 2: Place clothing in machine, one item at a time. Sort your items keeping towels in one load, basics in another, denim in another, and so on. Fill the machine just over half full with basics. Towels and denim should be washed in smaller loads as they're heavier fabrics.\nStep 3: Ensure middle dial is set to \"Normal\" or \"Soft\" and fill with water. The \"inlet hose\" is useless out of the box as you need an adaptor that the manufacturer assumed you had. One end has a rubber gasket and the other end does not. The gasket end is the part that would go to an adaptor, the gasket-less end goes to the machine. Why? Because if you hook the gasket to the machine, it's harder than heck to get it off without nearly destroying the hose. During the inaugural load, I did not have an adaptor, so I filled the wash basin with a bucket. Fill just slightly over half-full, any more will splash out during the agitation cycle.\nStep 4: Check to see of the machine is plugged in. I forgot to do this and sat there confused. Turn the \"Wash\" dial to 15 minutes and the machine will hum to life. Let the machine do its thing and come back when it is done. It doesn't make any alarm when it's done, just so you know.\nStep 5: You may come back to, what I would describe as a burning smell. I was alarmed at first but nothing was wrong, it's \"new motor smell.\" Turn the middle dial to drain and the water will come pouring out of the drain hose. There is no pump, so try to have the machine elevated or set in your bathtub.\nStep 6: Open the spinner basin and place a few items in, ensuring that it evenly loaded (about half of the wash load). Place the plastic insert in the bin on top of the laundry, close the lids. Is the middle dial still set to drain? Good. Leave it. Turn the \"Spin\" dial to 5. If you have the \"inlet hose\" hooked to an adaptor, this is where you can do a spin and rinse. If not, you can spin the suds out and wash again in clean water real fast, then repeat the spin. The machine will vibrate during the spin, and if it vibrates to a point where you think it is too much, stop the spin cycle and rearrange your items. Everything comes out damp, not wet. Like others have said: \"About 90% dry.\"\n\nWhen putting away the machine, tilt it slightly toward the direction of the drainage hose to get the rest of the water out. I set the machine aside with the lids open as to prevent a musty smell in the future. I will say this: Don't overwhelm the machine. Do a couple washes and allow the machine to cool and rest for a couple hours, say, while your laundry is drying on a rack. If you overexert the machine, it will break. EEK! It's more for daily loads (every day or every other day) than for a single day of wash (\"laundry day\").\n\nIt's a great compact machine that gets your laundry as clean as most large washing machines. It takes a bit more effort on your part to tend to each load, but it's easier than running up and down flights of stairs, digging in the sofa for coins, and fighting over the next machine. I plan on finding a cart to place this on so I can store it easier, and find an adaptor that will fit the inlet hose.\n\nI will update this as time goes on. It's a really simple machine, gets the clothes clean, and I am saving some money from the get go compared to the few bucks it takes each wash in the laundromat.",

        "content": "I'm impressed. This little machine packs a lot of power. I am happy to list both pros and con's of this machine. I've owned another brand (Panda) and model of this same type of machine. I bought it roughly a year ago to date and love it. It also gets clothes exceedingly clean and fresh, no spot or stain goes untouched. Even hard to get out grease spots from cars, etc. Both the Panda brand comparable machine and this Conway machine accomplish the objectives. With that being said, here are the Pros to owning this machine verses other similar compact twin tub washing machines. And verses regular sized standard machines\n\n1. If used properly it does in fact save water. I've done a comparison to the amount of water used in my standard full size washing machine and this particular model of twin tub compact washer. Again, IF used properly, and you do not over load the machine,(which means a small load -roughly 1 pair heavy denim jeans, 2 cotton knit shirts some socks, 3-4 pair of boxer or panties, a couple of hand towels/ OR a lightweight sheet set & pillow cases/ OR 2 large bath towels, 2 hand towels & 2 wash cloths) you use roughly 6-7 gallons on each cycle. Compared to 15 gallons per cycle for similar sized small load in a regular full sized washer. By cycle I mean each stage of washing. The main wash cycle, then a refill after spinning (rinse/softener added), spin again, then the final rinse & spin. You have the option to rinse while spinning each spin cycle however I find you can opt that aspect out and the clothes are still rinsed properly. It saves on wear & tear on the spin motor. (they tend to burn out easily on these machines if over loaded or weighed down)\n*Total wash time can be narrowed down to 19-20 minutes if your cloths aren't heavily soiled. Breakdown on that time table is as follows:\n5 minutes for wash cycles (drain while adding clothes to the spinner to save time, clothes will spin out fine even when drippy wet)\n2 minutes on initial drain\n2 minutes on spin cycle (heavy clothes will need maybe 3 minutes)\n3 minutes on rinse refill - fabric softener added during this stage (when small load and with 6-7 gallons of water used)\n2 minutes on second spin cycle\n3 minutes on final rinse refill and cycle\n2 minutes on final spin/ Then goes straight to clothes line or dryer depending on weather.\n19-20 minutes total time.\n**Heavier loads, larger loads or loads that require soaking, or longer washing & spin cycles will of course, take longer.\n\n2. Compared to other machines of comparable size/function others take longer to drain with the pump drain feature. This is a gravity drain which requires it to be elevated off the floor /surface & near a drain outlet to work properly. This can be accomplished by placing in a large full sized shower stall or tub in a bathroom, OR on a counter in the kitchen/laundry room then drain fed into a basin/sink. OR placed on a physical lift/sturdy flat wide object then placed near floor drainage in basement, etc. Simply switch to drain option and it does the work rather quickly. The Panda brand machine uses a motorized pump drain & can take quite awhile to actually pump out the water. Usually 10 minutes compared to the 3 minutes this Conway machine takes using gravity with no motor pump to break down or wear out (which happened to my panda machine which thankfully was under warranty)\n\n3. You can do larger loads even though the wash basin & spin tub are smaller. This is due to the power of both the washer & spin motors. I've washed 4 bath towels, 4 hand towels 4 wash cloths at once, they all got clean. I've washed a full king sized heavy jersey knit sheet set, it came out fine, highest water level used (10 gallons). Still a water saver compared to a standard regular sized machine. Times for each cycle & spin were slightly longer (roughly 2 mins added to each timer) with a normal full sized small load of clothes (5 knit tops, 4 pair of socks, a pair of lightweight pants, 3-4 pair underwear.) water was filled to just bellow the lint filter top and run on the lowest setting for 15 mins. Everything came out clean & fine.\n\nI've read in comments that people have difficulty with some clothes coming out torn. I've never had this happen on either machines of this kind. don't over load your clothing or add delicate fabrics like thin knits and silks or light weight fabrics to the machine on a heavy load and not enough water, and set your delicate fabrics to soft cycles and you should be fine. I've washed my satin nightgowns, lace panties, or dress slacks for my boy & husband several times and it's all in tact. Read your labels on your clothing & use common sense and you will be fine.\n\nOk so the cons:\n1. If you aren't able to stay focused on just doing the laundry at each interval it can be longer to do a single load given each phase of the load requires manual exchange from washer tub to spin tub & back again.\n\n2. You have to e mindful of the water filling the basin. It is manual. You can choose to hook up the hose to a water source and fill it OR opt to use buckets, gallons, ect to fill it by hand but that's a bit more time consuming and lots heavy lifting. I opted to hook it up to my bathroom shower outlet by unscrewing the shower head and using a small o-ring to tighten the hose to the pipe itself. A simple flat head screw driver (or butter knife if you're lacking a flat head screwdriver) then tighten it so there are no leaks. I used the rubber bulb (top) of a turkey baster with a cross slit cut into the rounded top side and attached it to the faucet with the panda machine hose. However the hose on this machine is slightly more narrow/smaller and wont fit the same.. It's a bit DIY depending on your water outlet/faucet/ pipes, hose, etc. but nothing complex. I recommend using a timer set on your mobile phone or a dial timer to set each fill basin so you don't have an overflow problem. (I found this out the hard way when I didn't realize this machine would not automatically shut off the water fill like my regular machine) So a timer helps..ALOT.\n\n3. If you're looking for a quiet machine that makes little to no noise or expect that there will be no water touching your skin, ever OR if you're looking for large capacity or little effort in doing laundry, this is probably NOT the machine for you. If you're into saving water, your time is valuable , and you just like really clean clothes that can be done in a simple efficient machine that may make a little normal racket from time to time on a spin cycle winding down, or you need a decent good machine for a small space then this is your dream come true.\n\nTIPS:\nI use HC friendly laundry pods (specifically Gain Pods). One pod for each load gets everything really clean & fresh without too many suds. I use Oxi Powder (3 tablespoons for 6-7 gallons of water, 1/3 cup for anything over 7 gallons water) This helps to deodorize, sanitize and is a color safe \"bleach\" without using harsh chlorine that also wears down the thin plastic hoses quicker.\nI also place my washer on heavy grade plastic cube crates tied together with zipties to keep them stable and together to elevate it for the gravity fed drain then place it in the tub in the bathroom. The water doesnt splash on the floor & the drain water goes right into the tub & down the drain, no fuss no mess. Any leaking it may or may not have ( I personally have not experienced any leaking with mine but some customers have said this can be an issue for them) is not a worry since everything is contained in the tub/stall. The electrical plug obviously goes outside the tub & up away from the water source. A small watt appropriate extension cord can be helpful in keeping everything dry & helps if you need more length in the cord to reach an outlet. Be mindful of the wattage that your outlet cranks out so you don't blow a circuit running the machine in the bathroom on a circuit not meant for that kind of motor/ampwattage(this has not been an issue for me, just wanted to include it)\n\nAll in all this is a great machine. Very efficient. Since I now own 2 of these types of machines for the price of one standard full sized machine my clothes have never been cleaner.and is a huge time saver for me to be able to do 2 separate loads of 2 different kinds at the same time. It's also space savvy for anyone in a tiny home, apartment, RV, Boathouse, or just a really space conscious person. It's light weight & can be reasonably lifted to store away. This is a lighter machine than the other brands of comparable capacity, function & size. significantly lighter in weight than my Panda machine of comparable size. I also recommend getting the warranty on it. For the price, it's a good safety measure to have in the event any mechanical issues or parts are faulty. The customer service is friendly and helpful if you are also friendly and polite.",

        "content": "I have wanted one ever since I got my first apartment without a washing machine, now my life is complete and I no longer have to hang with the weirdos at the laundry mat while handling my undies in public. It's perfect!\n\nIt took some maneuvering to find the easiest way to make it work in the apartment but I eventually found some things that I think the average user living in an apartment would find helpful.\n\n1 - In an apartment; set it up right next to the bathtub. Hauling water is no fun. At first I thought a 5 gallon bucket would be sufficient but as a 5'1\" 100lb girl, it was not. To do this you are going to need to find something to set it on that makes it higher than the bathtub to allow the gravity drain to work properly. I got lucky and found one next to my dumpster (seems like every time I pray to the dumpster god he provides) but my original plan was to go to the Habitat for Humanity Restore (if you have one in your area) or look on Craigslist, you can get an old kitchen wall cabinet that's almost the same height as the bathtub. The cabinet adds more useable space under the machine for storing items like the detergent and toilet paper. PRO TIP: save the foam from the packaging to place under the washer to keep it from bouncing around. Don’t forget the drain hose can be moved from one side to the other as well, just look on the back of the machine you’ll see.\n\n2 – If you are following my advice, you have it right next to the bathtub so don't bother with the plumbing. Like everyone here says, the included hose is short and it won’t fit anything American and chances are whatever water source you hook it up to, you will also need it for something else. If you plan on still being able to wash your hands or take showers and you have a washing machine hose in the way you will constantly have to hook up and unhook it. It’s a pain and there is a much easier way to do it. If you have an extendable shower head, use that instead. If not, it's an easy upgrade and you can get one for less than 10 bucks. But why not go ahead and spoil yourself and get one with multiple settings for your personal showers. Kill two birds with one stone and get a massage in the process! You need a hose that will reach it, so 5' minimum if yours is set on the opposite side of the tub from the showerhead. (Mine was) This is probable because the plumbing is usually all in the same wall so therefore your toilet will also be on the same wall. 5’ is standard for most shower heads, but be weary, I came across a few online that were shorter (non-American) so pay attention when you are shopping. I got mine for $19.99 with 5 settings. It was as easy as unscrewing the old one, adding some plumbers tape and screwing the new one in. My roommate thought I was a home construction wizard… ;)\n\n3 - ONLY FILL 3/4 FULL WITH CLOTHING! The washer works great if you don't overload it. The ratio should be about 3/4 clothes - 1 water. If you have something heavier like jeans in there keep an eye on it and make sure it’s able to spin. I have had to pull heavier items out a few times, or go in and separate things that have knotted together and become too heavy. Examp: my bra can get tied to a sweater and it becomes a ball of sopping wet heavy clothing that’s hard to separate. After a while you’ll get a feel for what not to mix and how heavy is too heavy to spin.\n\n4 - USE LESS DETERGENT! In a regular washer you wouldn't see the amount of soap that gets left in your clothing but now you will. 1. The washer is smaller so you need less, 2. You probably already needed less than you were using. I barely add any now. If you have soap residue left in your clothing your clothes will be stiff because you’re not going to tumble dry these in a dryer to soften them up. See number 7.\n\n5 - USE VINEGAR. I know it seems like it would be smelly, but it’s not it washes right out if you don’t use too much. If you don't have a dryer, lint is harder to get out of clothing. Vinegar separates the lint, hair, etc. from the clothing. You'll notice more lint in the trap after using vinegar in your load. And don't forget to keep that trap clean!\n\n6 - Winter use drying - It would be lovely to be able to place this outside to dry, but either you don't have an outside or the weather prevents it. So set up a space with full circulation to get the fastest dry. Hang pants from the bottom (see pic). It dry’s much faster, also spin that extra minute. I’ve noticed if I spin about a minute more than what’s necessary to get most of the water out dry time is decreased by about a full day. Usually you can remove some of the lighter items from your dry rack in about 6 hours to give the heavier items more air space. With this method I am able to get clothes fully dry within 24 hours.\n\n7 - This one is counterintuitive because I’m going to tell you the opposite of what everyone else is going to tell you. Wash cold/rinse hot or warm. I usually do it like this: 1st wash cold with detergent, 2nd wash is a rinse with vinegar to remove cat hair and lint and break down the rest of the detergent, 3rd wash hot with a small amount of fabric softener and some essential oils for the smell good just washed feeling. Here is why. The last wash leaves the clothes warm/hot and they dry faster and warm water softens the material and it doesn't leave them stiff. You can do all hot washes but your electric bill will go up. This took some trial and error and my clothes were very stiff the first month of using this. Finishing it in hot water and using vinegar made all the difference! After the clothes are dry just whip them out to get the last of the stiffness out, like snapping a towel at a bare butt, you know what I mean... It’s how I compensate for not having a dryer to tumble them in. I thought I was going to have to live without fluffy towels from here on out but using this method got my towels fluffy again!\n\nI’ve included a pic of how much dirty water is coming out of clothes to prove how clean my laundry is getting.\nHope this helps!",

        "content": " UPDATE 5/5/17: I've had this washing machine for 10 months now. It's still going strong. The bolts did fall out of the bottom a few times and we had to put those back. My biggest complaint at this point is that it's REALLY LOUD. I mean really really loud. Much louder than before. I can't sleep in my bedroom if it's on in the bathroom. I'm about to move into a duplex and I don't feel comfortable running it there because my neighbor will hear. It still works though and well worth the price.\n\nOkay so I will be posting up a video about this later on but I wanted to go ahead and get this review up because I've been using this little washing machine for two months now and it has far exceeded my expectations. I thought surely it would break, being as cheap as it is, but it has not (knock on wood!)\n\nI know a lot of people are a little bit confused about this thing but I now know everything you need to know about it so I am going to share that with you (and again, the video will be more helpful than this text when I post it.)\n\nIt has three knobs. One is the timer for the wash, one is the drain and was choice, and one is for the spin chamber.\n\nInside the washing machine on the right top corner, there are lines that show you how full to fill it for small, medium and large loads. I personally always put extra water because it makes it easier for the machine to agitate the clothing. Also on that side is a filter screen that must be popped out and cleaned once in a while. Do not fill it too full or it could spill out!\n\nOnce the clothes are done washing, you drop the drain hose (I have mine beside the bathtub and elevated, but we'll get to that) and click the knob to drain. This removes all of the water from the washing bin. You then take your clothes out one by one and put them into the spin bucket. You use the little plastic strainer looking thing to push down on the clothes once they're all in there. Sometimes I push them down, add more and push down again. I actually overload it quite a lot and it's never given me trouble. If it's too bad, the spin will go off kilter and I just take one piece out and try again. The wash tub is similar; if it's too heavy it won't spin counter clockwise. I take an article of clothing or two out and try again. I mean, I punish this thing and it keeps going!!\n\nOkay, so this is where people get hung up mostly. The hose. I will tell you exactly what you do right now. You take the FILL HOSE (not the drain hose) that it comes with, and you walk over to your trash can and throw it away. It's okay! Just throw it away. Yes, it will be fine, I promise. Here is where you get options - you can hook up a complex system with knobs and such, or you can just get two hoses from the hardware store in whatever length you want. Use hose clamps and place one on each side - one for the wash bin, one for the spin bin. Now, I have a detachable shower head. My husband bought a little piece that screws into the shower head hose (I remove the shower head when washing) that you then take either hose you want to use from the washing machine and push it onto the piece that's screwed into the shower head hose. Now, all you have to do is turn on the shower and it fills or rinses at your leisure! You can even walk away from it.\n\nYOU MUST ADD WATER TO THE SPIN CYCLE. I cannot stress this enough. This is how you get soap out of your clothing!! I let the water run for about 45 seconds or a minute, then turn it off and let the cycle get all of the water out.\n\nYOU MUST LEAVE YOUR LIDS OPEN AFTER YOU USE YOUR MACHINE! Do not let it mold up inside or smell musty! Leave those lids open and let it dry completely before closing them.\n\nTHIS MACHINE IS VERY LOUD. I live on a top floor apartment and I still worry that it's bothering my neighbor downstairs. I have a setup with cinderblocks, memory foam, cinderblocks, wood and more memory foam (and a nice covering) before I put the machine on top of that. I also have it bungeed to a towel rack for extra security. That doesn't cut the vibration nearly as much as I'd like, but the loudest part is when you're adding water to the spin cycle. Luckily that only lasts a few seconds. For this reason, I can only wash clothes during the day so as not to disturb neighbors. So far, so good.\n\nTHE MACHINE MUST BE ELEVATED ABOVE WHAT YOU ARE DRAINING IT INTO. Mine is elevated above my bathtub as this is where I drain it. Some people actually put it INTO the bathtub to use it but as I live in an apartment this is a noise disaster and doesn't work for me.\n\nSome key points:\n- This is not a set it and forget it machine. You control the fill, you control the drain and the rinse. The only things that are automatic are that the wash and spin will go as long as you set them for (15 min max for wash and 5 min max for spin.)\n- Clothes come out as ringed as they can possibly get - barely damp, so that is a plus!\n- You will NEED to purchase some hoses, adapters and hose clamps bare minimum. The fill hose it comes with is useless trash. Just accept this as reality and understand it's only a few more dollars and go to the hardware store and just do it. Do not break your back or waste your time trying to fill this by hand unless you absolutely have to. I do not recommend it. The wash tub is huge and that's impossible then to get your clothes rinsed during spin.\n- It's large! Bigger than I expected. I have it in a one bedroom apartment's bathroom and it takes up a lot of space. Keep that in mind. However, when empty it is very light and can be moved without too much headache.\n\nI would absolutely buy this again. I had settled on this one because I couldn't afford the one I wanted at the time but I am so pleased I got this I don't even think about the other one anymore. I'm very happy with this product!",

        "content": "After a few months of researching this and other portable/automatic machines, and being fed up with going to the laundromat, I broke down and bought this. I am fully aware this machine will require a bit more \"work\" as opposed to an automatic, but I'm ok with that. I don't have much laundry anyway, but I plan on just doing more frequent smaller loads throughout the week, and still have to go to laundromat for comforters, but that'll only be every other week. I figured I could suck up losing 100. on this vs. 300. on an automatic portable one if this ended up being a dud. I do have regular laundry hook ups, but my old style washer broke down, and I'm trying to baby my septic system. I have my eye on a full size HE washer in the next few months, and a plumber to re-route my washer grey line.\n\nI've used this a few times now, and initially I was disappointed at how small the washer tub seemed, the videos made it appear larger. I thought they sent wrong one, but nope, it was right. Just to give an idea, the tub part to wash is about 19 inches deep-from my elbow to middle finger tip. And, there's no high water mark that I can see, I just go by the lint filter, and fill to about the middle of that; which is about 5-6 inches from the top. I think if you go much higher than that, it'll start splashing out of the lid.\n\nFirst, I want to note, as others say just a bit of laundry detergent is needed. When filled up, this is about 10 gallons of water. I cringed at some of the videos where all you saw were suds. That doesn't equate to cleaner clothes. It can actually attract dirt and grease if not rinsed out good, and make the clothes stiff. I just did two loads of sheets. First was twin fitted, flat, 3 standard pillow cases. I realized after I should've used a bit more water. The sheets kind of bunched at the top rather than doing the whirlpool thing. Washed for 15 mins, then drained the water, refilled the tub part and added fabric softener. Did about 6 min rinse in the tub part and drained. Moved the 3 pillow cases to spin for about 3 mins. I noticed the polyester materials spun out almost dry, and the cotton one was fairly dry. So, next round I decreased to 2 mins and they came out the same.\n\nNext load was queen fitted, flat, and 2 standard pillow cases. They fit and washed fine, just made sure water level was high enough. Some may say ewww, but I reused some of the rinse water from previous load to wash this load. My clothes aren't soiled badly, and the water was clear. I used a 5 gallon bucket. I have a small cheap walmart end table that's just higher than the bucket, sit it next to my bath tub, and use my shower head to fill it. I also picked up a 10 foot outdoor extension cord at walmart. It's a light duty I believe, rated for 13 amps. I think the back of the washer says it uses just over 13 amps(?). I've checked the cord plug, it's not running hot/warm, have had no issues. I drape it over the shower pole and up the top of the bathroom door.\n\nWasher is easy to use. Oh, the directions....Even with my reading glasses, I can't read them. Print is itty, bitty, tiny, small. And was written by someone with English not as their first language, but what you can read of it was kind of amusing. Fortunately I'd done enough research and a bit of common sense, I had a very good idea of what to do/not do.\n\n-Most important, research this washer. It's not an automatic or a typical washer. Lots of videos here and on youtube. They'll show you exactly what's needed to be done to use this. Some people can't or don't want to do the extra work. Some of us don't mind it.\n-Yes, you can use the wash/spin at the same time. Make sure drain is closed/set to normal. There will be some water come out from the drain hose from the spin though.\n-Use soap sparingly. Lots of suds is not a good thing, it does not equate to clean.\n-Do not overload washer or spin part.\n-Overall it's quiet, but depending on the load, and what it's sitting on, there may be some vibrational noises-just an FYI for those in upstairs apartments. Saw someone mention using a rubber mat to help absorb the vibration/sound.\n-Be mindful, especially those with RV's or septic systems, each wash fill up that's full will be using about 10 gallons of water, and depending how you rinse(in the washer part or the spin part-another 10 gallons in the washer part. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to reduce the amount of water being used. Need to figure out how to rig something up to use the spin part for rinsing since hose won't fit from my shower to the intake part. For now, I'll just reuse the rinse water where I can, maybe even use some for mop water.\n-It weighs about 25-30 lbs. I don't find it heavy, but I'm used to lifting heavier items. It does scoot easily on floors too. Look into a furniture dolly, about 13. at Home Depot if you have trouble lifting/moving.",

My unit was replaced.\n\nOnce again, life got in the way & took me awhile to try the replacement. I use it tonight for the 1st time.\n\nI found it very convenient, easy to use & AMAZED how well the “dryer” worked.\n\nMy husband is a big guy & his clothes is heavy. Even his clothes came out almost dry. I dried 2 shirts at a time & 1 pair of jeans at a time. I’m only going wash 1 of his jeans at a t. I think it was a little much for his jeans.\n\nI have 3 suggestions.\nGet a bathmat wherever you use the unit. One YouTube creator said his last use scuffed up his tub. I personally don’t want risk it. I bought one.\n\nI have drain “protector” that helps keep long hair going down the drain when shower. This came in handy bc last night at one point I noticed the water was draining slowly. It turns out that drain protector was covered in lint. I cleaned it off & the water drains fast. The lint catcher catalog of lint. That’s why it’s there. It doesn’t catch everything. So it’s worth getting something going over your drain so your doesn’t get clogged.\n\nRun the “dryer” 2xs. NOT because the “dryer” doesn’t work. It will help the drying. IMO. A habit I got into when I had a top loader. This is not necessarily just my preference. Especially with heavy items.",

        "content": "Very detailed write up after having this machine for a year:\n\nI live in a big city that doesn’t have washing machines in most apartments, so I bought this to try and hack the system. This is probably the best purchase I made for my apartment, but let me tell you some mistakes I made/how I fixed it/flaws overall.\n\nIt came very well packed and was ready to rock and roll. I experimented on how to best place it and found putting it just straight in my bathtub was the winner. It will be a bit loud but my neighbors have said they’ve never heard it (I’m in an apartment building). At the time, I didn’t have a shower head with a hose, so I was putting it on its side under the bathtub spout — don’t do that. The amount of times it fell over and actually snapped off the top of the washer side (not spin side) was a lot. I’d suggest buying a shower head with a hose — game changer.\n\nAs for how much it can wash at a time, I can do a queen bottom and top sheet with 4 pillow cases. However, even though it can’t fit maybe all your dirty clothes at once, the actual wash time is so short it doesn't bother me. I do 9 minutes in wash, 3 min in spin, 9 minutes in rinse, 3 more minutes in spin.\n\nI also use scent beads, laundry detergent AND tide pods (gotta find the best mix if you don’t have a dryer haha) and there has never been any issues of the pods or beads not dissolving.\n\nSince it’s a water machine, there will be mold in some places, but no where your clothes actually touch (ya win some, ya lose some). For example, the hose where all the water drains may collect some mold.\n\nAlso, just be aware that if you’re putting your clothes in the spin side after the initial wash (with soap) and you don’t switch to “drain,” it will fill up with bubbles and slow the spin.\n\nAlso pt 2, make sure you press the spin white grate down (the little circle thing you use on top of your clothes in the spin side) or it may not spin properly.\n\nThough there are flaws, this is still a great purchase. Would definitely recommend!",

        "content": "I bought this machine back in 2015 when I rented my first apartment and it never let me down and saved me money. I moved into a house and bought a brand new GE front load washing machine that has been nothing but headache and a big waste of hard earned money if I could I would shoot it with a cannon lol anyways I bought another one of these small machines since I gave my old one to a friend that still uses it till this day. Now I’m enjoying my old routine having a few beers while doing laundry and it gets my clothes a lot cleaner than any he machine since it actually fills with water and thrash’s my clothes in vortex of water and detergent and a serious spin that extracts instead of being slopped around in a shallow puddle of H.E BS that takes over a hour to barley do anything that reflects a good wash. Yea it’s not a fully automatic machine BUT IT DOES ITS JOB AND DOES IT WELL and that makes it worth the extra effort any day of the week. If you live in a apartment with no washing machines I would highly recommend. If you have a nice big house and are in the market for big new machines SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY ON COMMERCIAL SPEED QUEEN MACHINES THAT ARE BUILT TO LAST A LIFETIME AND WILL CLEAN BETTER THAN ANY H.E MACHINE AT BEST BUY.",

I left a U.S. nickel in a pocket, it ended up destroying the spin side of the machine.

Haven't had to go the the laundromat for 4 years. Sure the folks you meet there are interesting, but saving quarters is pretty cool beans as well!\n\nYes it's a bit of a hobby doing laundry with this small machine, it takes more time. You'll get very good at fine tuning the procedure to get you clothes very clean. This little machine has plenty of power to pound the heck out your filthy blue jeans in the wash side. As for your delicate unmentionables, it will beat them without mercy until all the filth begs to be let down the drain.\n\nOn the spin side, it is surprising how fast it spins your clothes getting them close to dry.

A quality made toy. There’s music to it which is fun. It’s nice there’s an option to turn the music off if desired. The handle does have room to store each ball which is nice to avoid lost balls. My only concern is the handle isn’t the sturdiness. It can move side to side if he becomes off balance when walking & it has fallen over. That’s where I wish it was a bit more durable.

        "content": "This was an excellent purchase. Very user friendly, easy to maintain and clean. The overall size of the COSORI Air Fryer 5 QT is perfect for small to large size cooking. I am not a fan of too many kitchen appliances but I will say that this is well worth the investment for what it does and the rewards that it yields to your time management, nutrition and economic needs. Overall design and color is sleek, and simple, a little more boxy for my taste and space availability but I am able to live with it for the benefits that it yields.\n\nFood experimentation was successful each time. The lamb chops came out excellent although I would try a lower temperature to begin the cooking process and finish it with the preset temperature at a shorter interval. The steak fries was also an excellent tester that passed the experimentation. The giant prawns cooked to the exact specification of tenderness on the preset temperature for seafood. This appliance is powerful from the standpoint of its cooking ability. I can put the ingredients in an 20-30 minutes later its done to the perfection that I require without having to spare a moment to keep an eye on it while I am busy with another task.\n\nI especially enjoy the fact that it is an easy to clean and maintain kitchen appliance. The basket is easy to clean even after it cools down and the crustiness from the food hardens. A quick soak in warm soapy water after the basket cools down and soft sponge does the trick. No residue of smell left in the pan at all. The inner housing can be easily wiped down with a damp cloth when the entire appliance cools down makes for easy maintenance - no more than 1 minute.\n\nIt does make a huge difference in the prep and cooking when you need a quick and healthy meal after a long day of work. The COSORI 5 quart was the best after looking at a plethora of other air fryers and also having tested with my sister's (not COSORI brand). The cooking basket height and width is excellent - spacious cooking, especially if you like pans that give you room to maneuver the ingredients. The overall size of the appliance for the countertop would be slightly larger for a small kitchen with less countertop space but if you have room to spare you would hardly notice it taking up room; but for what this appliance does, I would say that the space issue becomes a non-issue.\n\nThe initial and subsequent cooking in the air fryer did not yield an odd smell that you would normally get from non-stick surfaces. I did follow the suggestion to preheat and I did it with a bowl of water-vinegar solution in the air fryer for about 20 min cycle two times. The price point for this appliance was reasonable especially for what you are getting. HIGHLY recommend this particular model of COSORI.",

        "content": "I've owned a number of different brands of Air Fryers over the past 10 years and it has been very hit or miss. I moved into a smaller place recently and wanted a new Air Fryer that was better suited for smaller spaces and not take up too much counterspace. I searched long and hard and decided on this one. There is another version of this one that is slightly smaller and is WiFi enabled. I elected to go with this one since I could not think of a situation that I would want to control this unit remotely (although you can see the WiFi indicator on the touch screen, it doesn't light up and there is no WiFi functionality in this unit. I assume the control panel on the WiFi version is exactly the same or they plan to make this one WiFi enable in the future as the reason for it being there.\n\nI've used it several times already to cook wings, fish, shrimp, and I even cooked a NY Strip in it (yep! I Air-Fried a steak... I know, I know... I said the same thing to myself that you are thinking while it was cooking), but to my surprise, using the preset worked like a charm. The steak was evenly cooked to a perfect medium well temp, just the way I like it. It was juicy, had a little char on the edges, tender and delicious (I cook a mean steak regardless). When I cooked the wings using the Chicken preset, I ended up adding additional time and increasing the temp since my previous experience with other Air Fryers indicated that the presets always undercook chicken, besides the fact that I like to flip them towards the end to ensure they are crispy all the around. The unit indicated 20 minutes @ 360 degrees. I changed it to 25 mins @390. At the end I flipped and added an additional 5 minutes for 10 wings and then after a total of 30 minutes Bam!!! Perfectly cooked chicken wings. I reduced the time by 5 minutes if I'm only cooking 5 wings or so. Pause at the 5 min remaining mark and flip. They come out just as crispy as if they were deep fried (non-battered wings) Now, 30 minutes is in no way faster than pan frying but waiting a little longer for healthier food is not a deal breaker in my book, especially if the food turns out good.\n\nThe unit has a number of presets including one for Fries that alerts you when it's time to flip. I have not used that preset yet but found the presets on every Air Fryer I have owned, to be hit or miss.\n\nCleaning is a breeze. No, seriously, you cannot get any better than this. Simply let the unit cool. (DO NOT run it under water while it is hot, as it will warp the aluminum pan due to the rapidly changing temps which will also cause the Teflon coating to start to separate prematurely from the pan).\n\nRemove the crisper tray and run it under water or use the sprayer and then gently wipe it with a wet sponge or dish cloth using just warm/hot water or a mild soap. The rubber ends are removable, but I just leave them on and clean around them. Rinse the pan and wipe the same way. This is the easiest Air Fryer to clean. The non-stick surface, like all other Teflon based coating will deteriorate over time or improper care, therefore, use silicone, Teflon based or wooded utensils in it to avoid scratching the surfaces.\n\nIt comes with no cookbook or any other accessories. There is an App that you can download that controls the Wifi version, but the App has dozens of recipes specific for use with both this model and the Wifi version.\n\nIt has an actual on/off button where most units need to be unplugged (I unplug it anyway since I don't trust touchscreen automated electronic panels which when defective can cut the unit on by itself). It has a timer and a preheat option. You can pause the unit, so you don't have to reset the temp/time if you open it to check on your food allowing you to continue once you close it (major plus). The outside of the unit does \"not\" get hot. The fan ports the hot air out of the rear and has a built-in guard to ensure you have space behind it so that it is not flush up against the wall. There is a startup process when you first get the unit. Following the instructions, you basically run through each setting and a few presets to familiarize yourself with it. You'll run preheat which will burn off and residual oils left from production. Unlike MANY of the others I have own or tried, there is no burning plastic odor when this thing is running. I had a different brand with an oven door and trays instead of a pan, that smelled like burning plastic that didn't go away until I THREW it away.\n\nI chose this brand over so many others since I bought my daughter a previous model of the same brand. Since I have not heard a single complaint about it in 3 years' time, I conclude that it is still running fine because she would not hesitate to call me and let me know how much she hates the piece of junk I bought for her for Christmas that one year.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this unit, although it did cut off prematurely once during cooking, but has since operated fine. I've had it less than 30 days but so far so good. It seems well thought out in the engineering department. While I should probably return for the one glitch, it has likely been resolved once the unit was unplugged and plugged back in.\n\nI highly recommend this unit if you are only cooking for 1-2 people. YMMV",

        "content": "Overall I’m pleased with my Cosori 6.8 Qt dual blaze. There a few things I think you guys could innovate to make slightly better, but they wouldn’t stop me from buying the product.\n\nThe first Cosori we got was the 5.8 quart. The basket fell apart after a year though - the part where the plastic front was attached to the metal basket sort of disintegrated where the screws attach. Also, it was frustrating that the drawer was on a slight tilt forward, meaning if you pulled it out even a little it continued to slide forward and down on its own, which could lead to falling if you don’t have a massive amount of counter space in front of it. I loved how versatile it was for cooking though. This definitely got me hooked on air fryers. If I had done more research I might have realized that Cosori have a 2 year guarantee, so I should have contacted the company to see if they could give me a new basket. We just went ahead and bought a new one though because I wanted it to be slightly bigger.\n\nThe new one we got is the 6.8 quart dual blaze. This one has some improvements. I don’t know if the inside coating is actually different, or if it’s just been a while since I had the old one and I”m misremembering, but this one seems easier to clean. Everything wipes out really easily. It has a removable shelf inside instead of an entire basket you lift out. The shelf is easier to clean as well. The old basket had all the holes and slats that could be difficult to get grease/debris out of.\n\nThe only issue with the shelf is taking it out. It has two holes in the center that you're supposed to put your fingers through to lift it out. However, when your food is ready and it's hot, you obviously can't do that! So you have to get the food out itself with a spatula or tongs. If you do try to tilt the entire drawer over, the shelf falls out with the food. I think it would be good to have a handle that sticks straight up in the center, with a threaded screw hole in the center of the basket. That way you could grasp it to lift it out if you were making something like fries, etc, but if you wanted to cook an entire chicken you just unscrew the handle, and voila, the shelf is flat again.\nI also think they should make four divets horizontally in the corners of the drawer, so that the shelf stays put if you do want to tilt the entire drawer over to dump something out. These divets should be strong enough to hold the shelf in place for an easy tilt, but with the screw-in handle it would still be easy to exert enough force on the shelf to remove it if you wanted.\n\nI would also recommend putting little foldable “feet” on the sides of the shelf, so that you could raise it if you wanted, and cook something both in the bottom of the drawer itself and on the shelf. Again voila - instant accessory. That to me is a major selling point, and I doubt I'm the only one that would love a built in accessory like that.\n\nOne more thing - the dual blaze has the settings of reheat, broil, bake, air fry, and roast, but it does not explain in the instruction manual how the dual burners function accordingly. Example, air fry is both burners on high, broil is top burner high, bottom burner low, etc. I had to scroll through a dozen FB posts to try to find out if somebody knew, and I still only found 4 of the six settings. These should be clearly in the instruction manual.\n\nBoth products are still great and I would still recommend them, as evidenced by the fact that I bought another Cosori :) Just tweaks that would make them even better and might get some people more sold on them.\n\nPs- one more pro. The new dual blaze is much quieter than the old one.",

        "content": "Update 2/23/23: Check RECALLS on Cosori website (see photo). This CP358-AF 5.8 QT Pro not affected by this recall as of today.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, NEVER use a NON-STICK COOKING SPRAY on any air fryer. It will ruin it and make food stick more. If you feel a compulsion to spray, spray the food ... not the basket. Also, don't scrub or use harsh abrasives when cleaning. Let it soak with the dawn dishwashing spray, or even water. (I've never placed it in the dishwasher, so I can't comment on how it stands up to that.) Most of the time, I've found that after it cools off I can just wipe it with a few paper towels.\n\nSecond, I love this air fryer. I personally prefer the air fryers with a detachable basket, which this one has. It's basically a basket within a basket. They are easier to use (from putting the food in to dumping it out) and even cleaning (by hand, at that). AND, this particular model has a replacement basket available for sale here on Amazon.\n\nThis air fryer is very easy to use. You press the power on button, then the preheat button, select the temperature using the +/- button and press the play/pause button. It tells you how much time it will take to pre-heat. Once it's preheated, added your food, press the temp/time button to toggle to the time, then press the +/- buttons to adjust the time. If you need to change the temperature or time at any point, you press the +/- buttons. (Many air fryers will not allow you to change the time or temperature midstream. You basically have to turn it off and start over. Not this one.)\n\nThe basket itself is a decent size. In fact, I think the only difference between this one and the higher capacity air fryers is the depth of the basket. This basket is more of a square shape with rounded corners, and it's not very deep. I like mine to have more surface area and not be as deep. I've found the food cooks faster and crisper.\n\nI haven't used any of the pre-programmed buttons because I'm either following a recipe, or the instructions on the food bag/box/carton. I've found that this air fryer cooks pretty darn close to the instructions provided on the bag, as far as time and temp. I do always preheat the air fryer, regardless of what the instructions say.\n\nMy only gripe, if I had to find one, is that I wish the cord were maybe 3-6\" longer since I sit my air fryer back on a center island (and the plug is down on the cabinet). Other than that, I really like this air fryer, which I got on sale for $89.",

The interior surface is well coated and very easy to keep clean. The grate inside the interior is kind of a force fit so it doesn't fall out with the food. But very easy to pull out to clean. Love the audible alert at the half-way point to let you know the food is ready to shake before it finishes frying (that's automatic when you choose one of the preset times). It's a small footprint on the counter. Cleanup is so minimal. It's really changed my life. Before I heated a whole oven to roast vegetables and it took about 40 minutes, and would heat up the whole kitchen. Using the air fryer it only takes about 18 mounts to roast vegetables and they come out perfectly. I've used it to reheat chicken tenders and pizza, baked frozen toasted ravioli, baked potato skins. It's fantastic.",

After bringing a 1-inch steak to room temperature with seasoning on it for an hour or so, I cook it at 450 degrees for about 10 minutes (5 on one side and 5 or 6 on the other) to get to medium rare (134 degrees before resting). The char I get on the steak is comparable to what I get on a grill but with much less time and hassle.\n#2 favorite would be the potato wedges, cut a potato into 1/8 wedges, soak in olive oil and seasoning, place them on their back in the fryer (no need to shake them at halfway point) and after 10 to 12 minutes you have perfect wedges. Now the steak has rested long enough and you are ready to eat a great meal ready in less than 1/2 hour!\n#3 An honorable mention has to be made for the small pizzas you can make in these!\n\nTake-away~ buy one that heats up to 450 degrees, when I first followed the directions that said 400 degrees the steak didn't have the nice crust without being overcooked - get one of those silicone baskets for easy cleanup - get one of those elevated grates, this puts the steak or other food up off the bottom closer to the heat source and for better circulation of heat under the food.",

        "content": "Approximately one month ago my wife and I bought a Cosori Air Fryer. We thought that the fryer would help this retired couple cook quick and easy meals with a minimum mess in the kitchen. For that month the Cosori met and even exceeded all of our expectations. Then things went wrong! In my first attempt to cook ground meat in the machine I thoughtlessly attempted to break up the meat with a kitchen tool. This action deformed the crisper plate. I attempted to remove the plate, scratching the basket non-stick coating rendering the basket a potential health concern. We reached out to Cosori Support in hope of purchasing a new crisper plate and basket. They responded almost immediately and advised that they did not sell the plates and baskets separately but would try to resolve our issue. After verifying our machine purchase they advised that a new basket and crisper plate would be shipped to us free of charge! In this day and age, it is refreshing to find a company who makes a quality product and will go the extra mile with it's customer service. I highly recommend this company and products.",

        "content": "*2nd Update* - I'm changing my rating to 4 stars because of the exceptional customer service from Cosori. They reached out and I explained the issues I was having with the first two air fryers. They graciously sent me a third air fryer, directly from Cosori, and this one works as perfectly as most of the reviews here state. I did not have any issues with a horrible lingering plastic smell and this one doesn't rattle at all. The basket even operates more smoothly, so third time was a charm. Still, one star off for the issues I had with the first two air fryers. Cosori takes good care of their customers, so don't hesitate to contact them if you have any issues!\n\n*Update* - I'm lowering my rating to one star. The 2nd air fryer has also developed a loud rattle when the basket is opened and closed and intermittently during cooking. The rattle on the replacement is worse than the first one. May end up returning this one as well.\n\nThere are some features about this Cosori air fryer that I love, so I'll start with those first. Food turns out perfectly every time and it's much faster and economical than using the oven, plus the convenience of this appliance can't be beat. The large 5 quart capacity, for the low Black Friday price I paid, was an added bonus. I also like that the maximum temperature goes up to 450 degrees for searing, compared to most other air fryer's 400 degrees.\n\nNow for what I didn't like. I'd read reviews about the strong and persistent odor but since my other air fryer, an Instant Vortex, didn't have an issue, I didn't expect this brand would be a problem. I ran the air fryer through the initial start-up according to the instructions. The burning plastic odor was significantly worse than my other air fryer to the point that it set off my smoke alarm for the first time ever, which really surprised me. The unit wasn't smoking but apparently the vapors released by the unit were triggering the alarm. This was very concerning. I unplugged it, let it cool, and tried it again. The alarm went off again. I finally finished the break-in process outside (although, the odor was still very strong outdoors) and eventually the burning plastic smell subsided, but I soon encountered another problem. The air fryer's heating element started rattling and vibrating badly whenever the basket was opened and closed. It also sometimes rattled while cooking. I decided the unit I received must be defective so I sent it back. I took a gamble and ordered a replacement. I did a few break-in cycles outdoors this time, which shouldn't be necessary, but I didn't want to take any chances. This unit seemed to be slightly less smelly. There are also no rattling sounds with the new one.\n\nI've head such great things about the Cosori brand but when I compare it to my Instant Vortex air fryer that I've never had any issues with, this Cosori model isn't nearly as solid feeling and the quality just isn't the same. Since the price of this model was so good, I was considering buying others as Christmas gifts but changed my mind after my experiences with it.",

        "content": "My wife and I are so pleased with the COSORI 5 Qt Air Fryer. It put the fun back into cooking! It's the ideal size for a couple. Besides looking great - it can cook at 450 degrees - more than most air fryers. It also came with a 2 year warranty. It has 7 presets, ability to preheat, and a shake option. It doesn't consume much countertop space - its only 10 inches wide. It sits next to our stove. Additionally, we have a 12 inch wide butcher block cutting board that sits on our electric glass top stove. When we use the air fryer we place it on the butcher block cutting board under the exhaust hood to eliminate smelling up the entire house. And if we are also using our oven - the hot stove top does not affect the rubber feet on the air fryer. It did require researching recipe cooking times & temperatures along with a few trial and errors - then recording what really works on note files on our iphones for future reference. Research showed that some additional accessories also need to be purchased to get the most out of the air fryer. The basket dimensions of the 5 qt air fryer are 8.6 in x 8.6 in. We opted not to purchase their accessory pack - but instead purchased what we thought were better choices. Here is a list of the accessories we purchased: Soleader Plate Gripper (set of 2), Casaware 7 inch Ceramic Nonstick Pan, Dowan Ramekins 8 oz (set of 6), The Sweet Baker Professional Silicon Baking Cups (set of 12), and P & P Chef 7.5 in round racks (set of 2). Things we have done thus far with great success: chicken wings, drumsticks, thighs, steak, toast, fried pickles, eggs, pizza, tater tots, french fries, french toast, and baked potatoes. My favorite breakfast, poached egg on toast: crack 1 egg into a silicon muffin form (with a hint of avacado oil wiped around), cook for 6 min at 380 (no preheat) - and add toast after 3 min - just too easy. Cleanup after air fryer use has been very easy, a hot water spray and sometimes a bit of dishwasher soap.",

        "content": "I saw a recommendation for this air fryer and decided to check it out. Amazon had a sweet deal on it, so I couldn't pass it up. This unit replaces a Ninja model I bought just over a year ago. The Ninja worked well, but I couldn't pass up a new shiny!\n\nUpon arrival I saw it arrived in a Cosori-labeled outer box, so shipping was not anonymous and porch pirates could steal it pretty easily. The unit was double-boxed but they went overboard with the packing tape on the inner box! All they needed was ONE piece as a security feature to show it had not been tampered with, but the entire top was sealed tight.\n\nAfter liberating the fryer from its box, I removed all of the packing material inside it and washed it as prescribed. I followed their two-step bakeout procedure and for the first time was very surprised to smell ZERO outgassing products! The first air fryer I tried was so obnoxious with plastic outgassing I had to throw it away. The Ninja wasn't bad, but it still needed a couple initial bakeouts. The Cosori was completely unobjectionable.\n\nSo far, I've run a batch of Ore-Ida french fries through it and a bag of Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien. They both came out great. I like the touchscreen on it and the keep warm feature is real nice. They advertise a shake reminder which is good, but it only works at the midpoint of whatever time you set. Not the absolute most convenient. There's a bacon setting. I'm curious how that one will work.\n\nThis brings up a good design feature - the basket is a two part assembly. The inner part which is perforated to allow drippings to fall through is the part attached to the handle. The outer part is comprised of an inner solid aluminum shell and an outer plastic shell for insulation. Both the inner half and the inner shell are aluminum with a nonstick coating. So far, they're very slippery.\n\nThe fryer also incorporates an automatic shutoff circuit when the basket is removed. So, when you want to shake your food, you can just pull out the basket without fiddling with the controls (although, there is a pause button). The fan and heater will shut down and then restart when the basket is reinserted. The fryer settings remain unchanged so it just picks up where it left off.\n\nI don't recall seeing anything about the basket being dishwasher safe. Handwashing isn't that big of a deal, but the parts are bulky and fill up a normal-sized sink pretty quick.\n\nI'm going to play around with it more over Christmastime and see how the bacon and steak features work. So far, I'm happy with it and I see it featured in several online recipe websites. If Amazon has it for sale for under $100, I would recommend getting one.",

I think the size is great for placing where they are needed, and they are easy to read. When I first received them, I placed all four of them next to an old old analog hygrometer I had, and all four displayed about the same reading as the old hygrometer. Quite close enough for my needs. I like placing them in different parts of the house and basement so I can keep track of temperature and humidity. In the summer, I especially will find these useful in the basement so I know if I'm succeeding in removing excess moisture with dehumidifiers. In the winter, I have already found them very useful in making sure humidity is in the correct range. It's also handy to see the temperature displayed. I have not owned them long enough to rate battery life. So far I'm very pleased with this purchase.",

So, now I know that humidity level is around 35%.\n\nI did a test. I placed it in my shower a few minutes after taking a regular shower and it took about 8 minutes for the humidity to climb from 32% to stabilize at 87%! I find it very useful!\n\nPros:\n1- Large clear display and easy to read.\n2-Has a magnet on the back to stick to a fridge or ant metal surface.\n3-It takes 1 AAA battery that is easy to find compared to others that utilizes special thin coin style cell.\n4-Battery was included :)\n5-Inexpensive.\n6-It displays a smiley face when the humidity is within comfortable level.\n\nCons:\nNone at the moment. I will update if anything comes up.\nConclusion: Recommended ! 5 Stars.\n\nPrior to purchasing this product, I had no idea about the humidity level in my house.

Please familiarize yourself with all the parts and functions. The cutting edges are extremely sharp and must be always be used following the precise instructions, especially when using the slicing blades. NEVER, I repeat NEVER slice anything without using the cover attachment.\nIt is a small device, so if you are using it for a big job, you will need to empty the receptacle often because it fills quickly. I have used all the different blades and attachments and I am quite pleased with the results. Some of the attachments do not clean up easily because small pieces of whatever you are slicing or dicing get caught up in/along the VERY SHARP surfaces.\nI would say, this is more than just a functional gizmo; but use with caution ⚠️",

        "content": "Amazing. I took years trying to find the perfect chopper. Although I originally wanted one that was simple with only 4 blade sizes, I couldn't resist the price on this one and the reviews seemed to point out it was best regarding durability. It's so good even my mother in law loved it and so I ordered a second one just for her. Really saves time. The trick is to make sure you precut slices that fit within the frame and make sure you put the handle down fast enough, the slower the less effective it is. Blades are sharp. Finished boiled vegetable salad in less than 15 minutes vs a half hour or more with regular knife chopping. And I chop fast but when it comes to vegetables boiled they tend to stick to the knife. Buy it its worth it. Also comes with free frother you just scan a code and it's free shipping too.",

I do not understand a lot of the negative comments; but I wasn't there when they had their problem. I experienced some of the cleaning problems, but quickly understood how to correct them. The multi-tined fork supplied with the product works wonders with a touch of patience. It can be a bit loud, but most of us play the TV and radio louder most of the time. My grates and chopping attachments are plenty sharp. No problem cutting anything yet for salads, salsa, veg medleys. Pare this with a good mandolin and you have an unbeatable combo - unless you are a professional chef with lots of time. It is sturdy and simple to use.",

I love cooking but it keeps me on my feet for longer than I can handle. This product is going to save me soooo much time from hand cutting/chopping. I just got this chopper this week and used it few times. I love it already!\n\nEverything that is included with the chopper and storage for blades feel very heavy duty, not cheap. The blades are extremely sharp making cutting into tomatoes smooth and avoiding making salsa instead of pico. (yes it’s happened to me) i do recommend if ur not a strong knife user, want to save time, want everything cut the same size, ect.\n\nThe one thing I believe will make using this a bit challenging is the inserts are very tough to remove.

I found a wooden skewer easier to use than the included cleaning fork. I think I will buy a mini-processor with hand pull and dedicate that to onion grating, as it will be easier to clean. I did try to follow the directions of one reviewer who did many pounds of homegrown onions with the machine and the machine worked very well creating dice. It was the lengthy cleanup that took all the joy out of the process.\n\nI still like this unit very much and will keep it for bell peppers. It took me 30 minutes to wash 6 bell peppers, clean out the insides, dice them, and clean the machine. The washing up was so fast, it would work just fine for 1 bell pepper. Just be aware it makes enough sound to wake up a baby. I haven't tried the machine on anything else yet, but I expect it will be useful for dicing potatoes and grating carrots.\n\nI got the 10-in-1 version because it has plastic containers for storing the very sharp dicing and grating blades. The containers keep everything safe and compact during storage.",

In the past, I had a KitchenAid product similar to this but much more expensive, which I had to move on from when the slicing blade bent since the blades are not purchasable separately. This product has a very high quality feel to it with the build and feel of the plastic, the quality English in the instruction manual and the packing it came in. Some things that I would have liked to see in this: slightly larger in size so that the leverage would make it easier to process potatoes, a second thinner slicing blade as the included one is 2mm thick, a design that would allow all the parts to be stored/attached to each other when putting away (I may have missed something, but the small size of the storage container part means I can't lock the top down in place with the blades inside I probably should have gone for a product that is specifically designed for dicing potatoes as that is the main thing I want, but I don't like single or very few purpose devices in general if a multi purpose device is available.

I think they’re too big for small light mice who don’t trip the platform. So I’ll need to get the smaller traps. I suppose the good news is that I probably don’t have rats! (Something ate a wire in my garage parked VW last week - a $500 fix!). I did catch one small mouse in a different disposable trap I bought elsewhere. So the campaign continues.",

        "content": "These mouse traps are absolutely amazing.\n\nWe live on a ranch and have been fighting mice since we moved here.\n\nI've used rolling traps, and the old-fashioned wood snap traps.\n\nI thought we had gotten most of the mice, then I noticed there was one really obnoxious little mouse who would run across the counter stop and look at one of the mousetraps sniff it and turn and run away.\n\nOne day he ran across the top of the TV screen stopped and stared at me, the war was on.\n\nSeriously this felt like an old episode of Tom and Jerry with the mouse always getting the better of us.\n\nOut of desperation I ordered these traps. Baited them with a little peanut butter and a little sliver of dog biscuit which they for some reason love. I know they love them because they chew holes in every bag we get.\n\nSo I set out two mouse traps with baited with peanut butter and dog jerky treats, I placed one on the counter and one one behind my recliner where I sit.\n\nIt could have been much more than about 5 minutes when I heard this weird noise, I didn't recognize it cuz I'm so used to the other snap traps. When my wife said you know I think that might have been one of the new mouse traps.\n\nSure enough I look behind the chair, and there he is Jerry all bloody and dying. Yep none of those humane traps around here.\n\nThe one thing I will say is these aren't nearly as powerful as the old wood snap traps, the old wood snap traps would break their necks and kill them almost instantaneously.\n\nThese aren't quite as powerful, don't get me wrong they snap down on them and kill them but sometimes it doesn't kill them right away. They sit there and twitch for a while, a few times we've had to search for the trap as they've drug it off. They don't drag it far.\n\nBut seriously these things are super easy to bait, super easy to clean, they don't hurt nearly as bad if you get snapped in the finger with one.\n\nAnd they're reusable.\n\nBut the most important part is they work and they work much better than the old wood traps. Within the first day of using them we caught eight mice.\n\nIt's like my whole day was spent doing nothing but baiting these mouse traps.\n\nWe have literally eradicated every mouse in every living space on our property. It's been probably two weeks since we've caught a mouse, I see no traces of them, no mouse droppings, no two holes in potato chip bags and flower bags or sugar bags.\n\nWe do have traps out continuously, we have to rebate them once a week because of peanut butter and dog jerky treats tend to dry out.\n\nSo like I said if you're on the fence about these, just buy them they're worth every penny. With that said you might have to experiment with what your mice like to eat. Not hard to figure it out just go through your pantry and find out what they've been getting into and bait it with that. Around here it was the dog jerky treats that they liked.\n\nAnother tip is come springtime the mice are less interested in eating and more interested in mating so baiting traps with food isn't quite as effective as it is the rest of the year. During the springtime I recommend getting some pheromone bait and putting a couple drops in the bait holder. Along with a couple bits of string, they like string and yarn for their nests.",

However, while they worked, finding the dead mice was an awful experience. The smell was wretched and it took way to long to figure out where their little corpses were.\n\nI finally decided to try these traps and I'm glad I did. The mice appear to be killed instantly. I keep disposable plastic gloves and grocery sacks right there so I can quickly glove, squeeze the other end of the trap so the jaws open and drop the mouse right in the grocery sack to be taken outside. I then drop the traps in a bucket of hot soapy water to clean them before reusing. I never have to touch the mouse, and I'm only close to it for a brief bit of time to drop it in the bag.\n\nI'm very happy with this product.",

I even made the weakness comment to my wife and immediately put my foot in my mouth because I accidently tripped it while fuddling around and caught my finger in the trap. \"*Expletive*!!!... Nevermind... they'll work\" was my reaction.\n\nAfter setting up some traps with some peanut butter in the removable dish (nice design, btw), I was a little worried after day 1 and the clever fella managed to reach past the trip platform and lick up the treat. I saw someone made the comment that they stuck a cracker in the peanut butter, and perhaps this made the mouse have to work at it more, and get closer footing? Idk, I'm not a mouse - maybe I just happened to have a cleaver customer. Anyways, I just put some Cheez-Its further back in the clamp and viola! Next morning I had a dead mouse. Cleanup was way easier than the old school traps, because you don't have to put your hand anywhere near the mouse to finagle it open - just pinch open the plastic clip over the garbage can and you're done!\n\nThese are a win in my book!",

There were still stains like it was barely cleaned, so I took matters into my own hands and found this stain remover. As SOON as I sprayed the cleaner it was like a magnet pulling out the stains. Once I started scrubbing though is when the magic happened. I saw all the dirt, spilt drinks, etc just come right out and my car seats literally look like new. This will forever be my go to stain remover. Also I want to mention the citrus scent and how natural smelling and amazing it is. I was scared it would smell like a fake overpowering citrus but it didn’t at all. I will say that I wish that citrus scent lasted longer than it did but I didn’t buy it as an air freshener. It did it’s job cleaning my seats.",

This solution I have found to work really well on those small seat stains in cloth material. The bottle I wish came in a spray bottle though for an easier distribution of the material. Instead I dab a little bit on a rag and scrub it into the fabric and let it break up the stains. I wait a little bit and then wipe the soap back off with a clean microfiber with a little pressure and it usually gets the stain out. There have been times where I had to go over the stain twice to fully remove it. In my opinion this isn’t a bad solution to have in your arsenal of cleaning supplies.",

    "description": "Product Description\nScan, Fix & Erase\nMOTOPOWER MP69033 OBD2 Scanner\nProfessional OBD2 Car Diagnostic Tool Engine Fault Code Reader\nProduct Features:\n\nMulti-Functions - Practical Multi-Functions OBD2 code reader features built-in OBD2 DTC lookup library, which help you to determine the cause of the engine light, read code, erase code, view freeze frame, I/M ready, vehicle information, data flow, real-time curve, get vehicle speed information, calculate load value, engine coolant temperature, get engine speed.\nWide Capability - Supports 9 protocols compatible with most 1996 US-Based, 2000 EU-Based and Asian cars, and newer OBD II & CAN domestic or import vehicles. Supports 6 languages - English,German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian.\nLCD Display - Designed with a clear display LCD screen (128 x 64 pixels) - white backlight and contrast adjustment.\nNo need any battery or charger - The code reader gets the power directly from your vehicle through the OBDII Data Link Connector.\nCompact Design - Car diagnostic scanner is equipped with a 2.5 feet long cable and made of a very thick flexible insulator. There are 6 buttons on OBD2 Scanner: scroll up/down, enter/exit and buttons that quick query VIN vehicle number& the DTC fault code.\nABS / Airbag codes NOT Supported - It is able to read and clear check engine information which is part of OBDII system, but it cannot work with non-OBDII systems, including ABS / Airbag / Oil Service Light, etc.\nWhat's in the box - OBD2 Scanner Code Reader x 1, Instruction Manual x 1\n\nHow to connect the scanner with the vehicle?\n\na) Turn the ignition off.\n\nb) Connect the code reader’s plug to the vehicle’s OBDII port\n\nc) Turn the ignition on. DO NOT start the engine.\n\nd) The code reader will then automatically link to the vehicle’s computer.\n\ne) Refer to the manual for details.\n\nWhy does the scanner’s screen not turn on?\n\nCheck the fuse for the OBD port in the vehicle’s fuse box. Usually, it’s the same fuse as the cigarette socket. If the fuse is blown, there will be no power for the OBD port, so the scanner cannot be power on.\n\nDoes the scanner support Air Bag, ABS, Brake, Suspension, Oil Service, Maintenance Reset or Battery Registration?\n\nNo. It can only scan the vehicle’s engine system and emission system, detecting the engine fault by displaying the fault code and erasing the fault code after the engine problem is fixed.\n\nWhy does the scanner not read the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)?\n\na)- Due to the different vehicle makers and models, some vehicles’ VIN may not be able to read by the scanner. A professional vehicle maker’s scanner is needed.\n\nb)- The vehicle’s computer may be blocked or revised before in purpose.\n\nWhat are the vehicle brands that the scanner supports? (Search Question / Ask others)\n\nTheoretically, it works with most 1996 US-Based, 2000 EU-Based and Asian cars, and newer OBD II & CAN domestic or import vehicles.\n\nBut due to the datalink problem with the ports, it may fail to connect with some vehicles in some circumstances.\n\nMore Products to Explore from MOTOPOWER\n\nOBDII Scanner - Classic\n\nOBDII Scanner - Enhanced\n\n\t\n\nOBDII Scanner - Advanced\n\n\t\n\nOBDII Scanner - Upgrade\n\n\t\n\nBattery Load Tester\n\n\t\n\nDigital Battery Tester\n\n\t\n\nBatt.

Now that I know where it is, it will be easy to find next time.\n\nI used it in my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee and in my 2008 Mazda Miata but it did not find any error codes. I bought it because my Check Engine light went on in my Miata, but I discovered it was because my wife did not put the gas cap on tight after filling up the gas. Before I received this device, I put the gas cap on right and cleared out the error light by disconnecting the car battery, so by the time I got the device, the warning light was already off. The Jeep had no warning lights on and the device did not report any error codes\n\nSo as of now, I'm assuming my cars are OK since the device did not report any error codes and there are no warning lights on either of my cars.",

Witch could put me without a car!\nSo I did some research came up with OBD searched on AZ came up with this one!\nI mostly check the comments on devices before buying! This was mostly good an cheap! After I got it I read an researched for my possible code list for my car an saved for present an future!\nSo used the device an ended up being a simple issue that is not a Cattasterfy! LOL emissions issue so I’m working on the suggested fixes from the internet when I typed in my car make model an year an issue code that brought up many finds they all said the same thing giving me a list of my own fixes I can try but that last one might end up costing me!\nBut I now know it’s not a car crippling issue!\n\nPS only took me about 4 times to get it to work right! Witch was my own fault I did not have the ignition on far enough to get the readings an it will tell you things to check an redo!\n\nLove this thing so far!!!!!",

Even the edges don't appear to have a significant amount of chromatic aberration\n4) Great for the price. (These aren't $1,000 binoculars... but they don't cost $1,000 either).\n\nCons:\n1) Although these focus well, you may find you need to make some small adjustment when viewing objects at different distances to get both eyes focused. Note: This is an issue with binoculars at any price point, but I find these might need to be adjusted more often. To do this you will need to cover the right objective lens (without touching the lens) and use the focus wheel to focus on an object. Then, cover the left objective lens and rotate the diopter ring (which is on the right eyepiece) until the the object is in sharp focus with the right eye. Now both lenses should be in focus. Not hard to do.\n2) Hardly worth mentioning, and I'm not sure I am explaining it well, but, for those who care, there is a slight bit of field curvature which means straight lines may appear slightly curved at the edges of the image. This isn't really noticeable if you are looking at stationary objects. The only reason I mention it is because if you are looking through the binoculars and sweep them from side to side, it makes the image appear to waiver a bit.\n\nAgain, I almost hesitate to deduct one star because the pros far outweigh the cons.\nGet a pair of these and have fun!",

My laptop is brand new and whether its my personal laptop or a work laptop (few years old) I noticed they always get uncomfortably warm on the lap.

        "content": "First off, I did not end up using the clips. I mainly have the trunk down because I am a fur-mom x2 (no 2 legged children); except for the neighborhood kids I take to church on Wednesday and Sunday, then the seats are back up in the sitting position.\n\nBack to the clips! Seeing as I have the seats down and pups in the back (American Staffordshire Terrier and Blue nose pit) I didn't want them walking on them, so they don't hurt the paws or snag on the felt interior. Also, the last picture I put a trunk cover down and didn't want that torn.\n\nFor the non-dog car rider people these clips go at the end of the elastic and it was tough for me to pull the elastic under the crevice of the seat and trunk then stretch and clip. One end is the loop the other is like a tighter L-shape and I would use pliers and close them into each other to fasten more securely. The clips work but not sure how long it will stay and not pup moving the seat from up to down position. Therefore, I secured mine with zip ties! They seem to fix it all just like electrical tape! j/k. The zip ties wont hurt the pups paws; I could give it more slack in the stretch attachments that come on the seat covers and it doesn't feel so tight that it is gonna rip them.\n\nTo be honest; that was my hardest part. Getting the backseat part on and then making sure they were nice and snug around the back part. Oh, and the front seats have a velcro snap to secure under the seat. Have to go under both sides of seats and feed them through the seat adjuster then velcro it.\n\nThe part about removing the headrest and cutting small holes to fit the headrest back over and also cut holes for the seatbelt snaps was easy. For the head rest cut a small pinch out about the size of a dime and that is perfect to fit it nicely. The seat belts about the size of a quarter and you can wiggle them through and if it gets too tough just cut a tad bit more and they fit nice.\n\nMy front seats look a little baggy in the picture because I have arm rest on my seats. I am going to got back and do the same like the headrest. I will remove the arm rest; pull the car seat cover into place taunt and then cut a small hole and put the arm rest back on. I was just getting tired and the rain was coming. Otherwise you could just cut a vertical line long enough to slip around the arm rest bar and down to the bottom of seat but that could be a lot of material cut versus a small size dime hole like the headrest.\n\nI also purchased the product for less than the NEW price. I picked the like new for about $13 dollars and they look brand new? I don't know if it was because the box appeared opened then taped back but mine look brand new and had no cuts or tears in them. What a deal!\n\nItem arrived quickly packaged nicely with no damage. Again, budget friendly for my fixed income disability budget. Seats are protected from dog hair and a quick spill of a drink if it happens. Got them in my favorite color too! Very pleased; would order again.",

        "content": "First of all, I want to say that now that they are installed, they look very nice. I have a 2013 Kia Sorento. My biggest complaint is that there were no proper instructions, just one sheet of paper with some confusing pictures that didn't help much. I had to come back to the video here on Amazon to see how to install them and even then, we were just winging it, hooking things here and there, wherever we could. Oh, and when I opened the box, the knife cut the top cover of the back seat cover as there was nothing between the box and the fabric of the seat cover, so buyer beware! I can't attest to the durability or the value for my money because, honestly, I just installed them yesterday, and no one has been in my back seat to test them. (I'll come back in a few months and let you know.) Installing the front bucket seats were easy enough, however, the seat covers do hide the mesh pockets that are behind my front bucket seats. But, other than that, they fit very well in the front. I kept trying to take off my headrests, and in my Kia, they do not come out. I realized later that they don't need to, as there is a hole that opens large enough to get over the headrests for the front bucket seat covers. Only the back middle headrest was removable, so we had to just fit the cover around the other backseat headrest poles. Also, it was very difficult to hook the straps under and around the back seats. A small person with very small arms may have less of a struggle than we did, but we did manage to get it done. Overall, (THUS FAR) we are satisfied with the seat covers. Honestly, I don't know how our back seats got so filthy, so anything is an improvement! I'm not looking forward to the day whenever I'm going to need to put one section of my backseat down for a load of something, but there are zippers that I can undo to be able to accomplish that. I just know it's going to be a little bit of a hassle, but it'll be worth it if they are durable and a good value for the money. We'll see. I'll let you know.",

I assume other cars back seat can be better access especially on suv or cross overs but for mine, it was difficult and the straps were not long enough to clip. So I’m making it work. The two front seats were easy peasy! I would buy again because they are somewhat cushiony and reliable.",

It was the picture of other VERIFIED PURCHASERS on Amazon that convinced me to give them a try.\n\nHave only had them for about three weeks and no negative comments. The picture is of a Pineapple plant being grown in the Fabric pot. Pineapple plants do not require much water and air temperature should be around 72 degrees. I like the fact that the roots will grow to the outer edges as well and will have air circulating to them through the fabric pot. Maybe no much but more-so if it were a plastic pot.\n\nIt has been three weeks since I transferred my plant to the new pot as it was suffering from over watering in the plastic pot it was in. Since I moved it to the Fabric Pot, the yellow on the leaves (an indicator of too much water or root rot) has gone away. No over watering on Fabric pots. So far very happy! I will purchase more fabric pots and will be looking at the 15 gallon ones.\n\nUpdate 5/17/20\n\nSo this week I attempted to move one of my 30 gallon pots with full soil and a fully grown Pineapple plant in it onto a 5\" Plastic pallet so that the fabric pot gets air circulation not only on the sides but from underneath as well and keep the pot from sitting on the hot concrete. I grabbed the pot from one handle and I tried to JERK Lift it onto the pallet and created a 9 in tear on the the handle I grabbed it from.\n\nLet me be clear, this is not in anyway a knock on the fabric pot and it was my fault. I was merely being a \"Guy\" about the whole thing and not looking for any help to lift it from both sides. The pineapple plant is prickly so I was just trying to get underneath it and get it on the pallet.\n\nSo here is the \"GOOD NEWS\". I had a spare same size fabric pot laying around, so what did I do. I carefully Double-Bagged the existing ripped pot into a newer fabric pot and I WAS BACK IN BUSINESS. E.g. one fabric pot into another. Try doing that with a cracked plastic pot. Lesson learned, call my wife next time to come help me :)\n\nI love this stuff and can't wait to get my hands on the 15 gallon ones. Last time I checked they were out of stock. Stay tuned for more lovely pineapple fabric grown pics.\n\nUpdate 6/22/20\n\nFinally have some good pics using the Fabric Pot Bags with full grown Pineapple plants in them. The bags must be a plus, as my wife and I are not experienced growers. Plastic pallets below Fabric Grow pots help keep them off the hot concrete and avoid having the bag rot due the weather elements.\n\nPic 1 - A harvested Pineapple from a Fabric Grow Bag Pot, YUM !\nPic 2 - Original Pineapple that has been in fabric pot since we purchased the grow pot bags\nPic 3 - Update from 9/22\nPic 4 - Update from 9/22\nPic 5 - Pineapple in blossom, YUM\nPic 6 - Fully grown pineapple plants in 30 gallon grow bags\nPic 7 - Side pic of pallet with another 30 gallon grow bag\n\nAll in all we have three active 30 gallon bags and looking forward to more. These bags are great.\nRecommend them highly!\n\nUpdate - 9/22/20\n\n- Cannot get enough of these pots. Take a look at the 9/22 pics. I cannot control the order of them when Amazon posts them but I wrote 9/22 on the image. One pineapple from these pots at about 14 inches tall. HUGEEEE. This was the double bagged pot that broke on me (my fault) months ago but going strong.\n\nThanks again",

SIMPLE\n* You get 4 round STICKY PADS and I had lot of fruit flies and so don't think my first pad will last long.\n* So getting REPLACEMENT PADS (if you have a lot of critters to kill) is a POTENTIAL ISSUE.\n* I plan to cut the pads out of the rectangular sticky pads I already have, so not concerned about buying their pre-cut, round, small, sticky pads (Some reviews say that are not always readily available???)\n* I would pay more to get this same on with a STRONG FAN (i.e. to create more downward suction)\n* This has 2 settings of fan speed and the higher speed is NOT as powerful as I would have liked.\n* On high fan setting, it does get MOST of the tiny flies that get over the top. HOWEVER, I saw numerous of them land on the top and \"hang out\" or crawl around on the top lid and NOT get sucked in. MOST get sucked in; I don't know why some seemed immune to the suction as they sat on top of the grate type of opening; more suction power would have pulled them down.\n* The other potential issue is: NOT all that get sucked in land and stick on the sticky pad; you can see them crawling around inside the container but NOT stuck on the pad. Only had it for 2 days and not sure yet if those end up on the stick pad, eventually? Will have to observe longer on this.\n* Finally, mine started working almost immediately in DARK KITCHEN where I have more than a few, much more, of the little bas-tids flying near the trap. Seller says allow 3 days; mine was almost immediately sucking them in.\n*.CONCLUSION: If I learn more or different I may update this. But it is working well for me; just not 100% on every fruit fly that gets near it (for some unknown reason) and a stronger fan would have made it work better.",

        "content": "I repotted a plant a while ago and promptly got an infestation of those little gnats that sometimes live in potting soil. I tried the vinegar/dish soap method for getting rid of them, some fly strips, and mouthwash, but I just couldn't get on top of them. They were multiplying faster than I could kill them. It was starting to gross me out, so I looked for another solution and found this thing. Within two days there was a noticeable and significant decrease in the number of gnats pestering me, and by the end of the week, they were gone entirely. (It also caught a rather large moth that had gotten into the house. I had been trying to shoo that one out, but it must have found the black light while I was sleeping and met its demise.) I kept it running (at night) for a while longer, just to be safe, but it did what it needed to do. A few weeks later, I had some fruit flies, and a couple of nights with this running took care of them, too. I've put it away for now, but it's nice to have for those infestations that come along from time to time. Hopefully I won't need it again for a while, but I like knowing it's there.\n\nIt's very quiet--I never heard it running at all. The black light isn't terribly bright--bright enough to attract the bugs, but not enough to be distracting while watching TV or anything. Changing the sticky pads is very easy. The auto timer works well. All in all, no complaints. (I should note: I have a fairly small, open-plan home, so putting it in the kitchen worked well, since the dining room and living room are all part of the same open space. I never had to move it to a bedroom or bathroom, though--it seemed to attract the gnats on its own, which was nice.)",

If I was to purchase another one I think I’d probably buy the newer version now that I know it actually works.\nThe only thing I dislike about it is that you have to have the sticky pads to go with it so that means you have to continue purchasing those. This is the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars.\nAll in all it’s a great concept. Before purchasing this I tried all of the hacks to try and get rid of the gnat problem I was having and nothing seemed to really work to get rid of them till this.",

It works fabulously for small flying insects like sewer flies, mosquitos and fruit flies. Note that this unit works only in darkness, indoors and not meant to be left on endlessly. Though I did leave it on for many days straight with no issues. After 24 hrs the paper traps were entirely coated with flies. We quickly ran out of the sticky paper traps so I ordered more (not cheap considering its just sticky paper). My fault I did not measure the diameter and just ordered Amazon's recommendations for refill and they were a size too small. Other than that, a good product. Quiet and compact and did what it was supposed to do. But the motor/fan could be stronger. Whenever replacing the paper traps I had to do it outside as many of the flies were still alive trapped inside the unit. Also had to use an old toothbrush to clean the insides. My flies are gone now THANK GOD! Will I use it again? Maybe if I had an indoor area infested with small, flying insects.",

        "content": "I purchased a scratchNdent and found my item had been used and slightly damaged, the top swirl grill was missing a small piece, and one of the sticky disks had been put into the unit already with a gnat stuck to it. Okay. I plugged it in, pushed one of the setting buttons (standard) and the light came on and the little fan makes a little bit of breeze, but wet a finger and hold it at the bottom and it is breezing out.\n\nIt is also bigger than I expected, but I have such a tiny bug issue in this place, I don't care as long as it works. Something was mentioned about it works better in lower light levels. So. I plugged it in and set it up in a place I have been having issues. Four hours later, I pick it up to look down in. There's a lot more than one gnat on the mat already. It's doing the job. Great.\n\nThe local little winged wildlife has resisted: letting the pots dry out good between waterings, watering with a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water, top mulching the pots, and the yellow sticky trap things. This seems to be vacuuming them up. YAY! If this works out I will get a couple more as I have plants in a few areas in my house.\n\nTrust me, I have at least six different microbugs including fruit flies, fungus gnats (arrgh!), a different gnat, and not sure exactly but a few are like tiny tiny various sorts of beetles... keeping the swarms down would be wonderful, without killing my plants. I will update this as it goes..\n\nThe picture isn't quite truelight because it is fairly dark in there, but. That's what it sorta looks like ON in the dark. To the right that is a matte BLACK surface that it's reflecting off of.\n\nEdit: my house is large, my buggie collection is way down on one end of the house where I have my first one, but. I just got a second one, also scratchNdent, to deal with the other end.\n\nI seen where someone complained that it is a fly-spa. This will NOT work on houseflies. They are too big and strong to be whooshed down onto the sticky pad. There are other ones built ($60-80) as wall sconces that WILL do the houseflies. This isn't built for that.\n\nHowever all the assorted little gnats and such are collecting at alarming rates on my sticky pads. It is nice to sit at my computer in the evening and not kill at least a dozen tiny assorted buggies. And my fungus gnat problem that came in with some potting soil mix, is pretty much gone.\n\nI can't say enough, if you have a grow booth and issues with little critters, that putting one of these in the booth at about two weeks for a night will not affect your grow and if there is anything in there it will clear out most of the problems. I have one room where the booth and most of my houseplants live (plus my spring starts as I go into that season as I update this) and the first one is outside the grow booth on the floor where it clears\nthat room pretty well.\n\nSecond one installed near the kitchen sink and other bathroom on other end of house, as there is a persistent problem there. I don't think it will catch sewer flies but those tend to respond to hot vinegar flushed through a running disposal with hot sink water, then follow with a cut up lemon and some icecubes run through the disposer. I will let you know if I get those little buggers back and if it can catch one or not.\n\nOn both I am turning them off during the day and on after dark, as that is when the UV light seems to be the most visible to the little winged pests. I also want to see if the kitchen one will draw spiders. There are a few kinds that are drawn to dead prey, and though I have sticky traps for them, if this will be able to stick one down or not if it comes to check it out. Another thing I will update.\n\nEdit update. Plant area one is catching mostly gnats, vatloads of them. Kitchen has only a few, but is getting the fruit flies from the bananas. I put spider traps near both and the kitchen catch is up. Could not be happier with both Katchys. Have spring bedding and flower starts going and a new grow in the tent. I’ve put one in the tent a few times and no gnattie problem (last time will be day/ night 18 so as not to mess up auto blooming). No chemicals. Still worth the price. Replacing the sticky pads is super easy too.\n\nEdit: very late fall. We are the house servants of two mixed breed part Persian purries. The grey and white one in particular has very fine hair and a very full coat despite daily brushing/grooming. So we have slightly pre-used fur all over. Plus lots of house dust-joys of where we live. I have to take a q-tip to the top of both my Katchy’s weekly to keep the house glorp from obstructing airflow (also have to do it to our tower fans). Still catching the tiniest no-see-ums, fungus gnats and fruit flies. With fall garden harvest, the fruit flies moved in. I added a capful of apple cider taped off with a few holes next to the kitchen one, and it was literally carpeted with fruit flies in the bottom. The plants that came in brought micro buggies, and those numbers are quickly dropping as well.\n\nA Katchy doesn’t instantly get your population but in days you should have a disgusting collection on the bottom pad… I purchased a no- zap UV/sticky pad catcher meant for houseflies and installed over the toilet at the ceiling. It also does the job with a little time. So. Katchy do their job well, are easy to use and maintain, and paired with a true flycatcher, really helps keep you unbothered. $40 well spent.",

        "content": "The item arrived broken :(\n \nI am SUPREMELY disappointed because I was so excited at the thought of having an effective method to combat my nemesis that is the mischievously thriving fruit fly colony which plagues me, and this item arrived this morning broken. :( The blades of the fan internally are not connected and are banging about inside. Though I don't normally pay full price for things unless necessary (I either wait for a good sale or use applicable coupons/promo codes), I took the plunge on this purchase due to my need for a competent and efficient resolve combined with it's GLOWING reviews! First, I had to wait 9 days to receive the item, which I wasn't happy about, but not upset either. I have literally been checking tracking daily and looking forward to it's arrival. Then it arrives *HAPPY DAY*. I opened the package, removed the unit (felt/heard something odd but didn't think too much of it at that moment), reviewed the directions, plugged it in and although the light came on, the fan did not. I thought maybe I need to press a particular button or what-have-you, so I re-read the directions. Nope, it should be automatic. So I then began inspecting the unit and realized the fan blades were not connected. I then even looked for a way to open the unit without busting it so that I can fix it myself (I'm incredibly handy and that's how much I wanted this to work!). No go. I could probably open it up, but then it wouldn't be returnable. Ok, so THEN I go to the item link on Amazon and as of earlier today, it said \"This item is currently unavailable\" followed by something to the effect of 'and we don't know if or when it will become available'. I attempted to contact the seller to no avail. My only viable option was and is to return it. I don't want to return it for a refund or leave a bad review. Rather, I want the working unit I paid and patiently waited for. Errrrr. I decided to go about my day knowing I'd come back to this later and here I am. ... I pull the item up this evening, it is in fact available again, but instead of the $39.79 price I paid 9 days ago, it is right now (6/15/2018) listed at $54.49. Whaaaa?? So I am leaving this review in hopes that the seller will contact me and make good on my purchase, at which point I would update my review to reflect the working conditions of this seemingly enigmatic device.\n\nIn summary, this 1 star review encompasses only that the item arrived broken and therefore did not operate as intended. A working unit may very well be worthy of all it's positive reviews. And maaaaybe even the new $54.49 price.\n\nI hope I am a unique case. I also hope this review was of help to you.\n\nUpdate 6/17/18:\nThe seller contacted me today apologizing for my inconvenience and explaining that Amazon is responsible for the damage done during the shipping of this product. I responded immediately that I appreciate the response and although I completely understand that Amazon assumes the shipping responsibility, I am also concerned that I cannot repurchase a working unit at the price I paid 2 weeks ago. I inquired how this can be rectified, stating that I fully intend to update my review according to their level of service and the actual benefits of a working unit.  And now I await their response.\n\nHonestly, if I have to repurchase at the higher price, I won't and I'll leave my review star at 1. It's not the price as much as the principle. Products can be damaged in shipping, that's understandable. But the seller is also responsible for commitment. So I'm really hoping they come through with a reasonable resolve that honors the price I paid for a working unit. I'll keep you posted.\n\nUpdate 7/1/18:\nThe seller not only replaced my originally bought unit, but included extras as well. They have been extremely diligent in correspondence and I can honestly say that I am not only satisfied, but impressed.\n\nWith that said, I would not have altered my review to 5 stars for customer service alone. ...these units works amazingly! The home I live in was built in 1924 and does not sport insulation the way a new home would. So pests are/can be/were a problem. The units do in fact attract flying things very well! The sticky pad of results had 2 bugs I didn't know I had and don't recognize. I am extremely happy with my purchase! And may very well buy more.\n\nThe unit itself is aesthetically pleasing and is relatively quiet. Night is the best time for results since that's when it's darkest and the bugs can 'see' the light. The blue light transitions in brightness, which is even more effective in attracting it's prey.\n\nI'm changing my review from a 1 star to a 5 star. I saw other reviews stating it was a flimsy design. I do get what they're saying, but how thick must this unit be to rectify that?? It works as intended and looks good doing it. The bottom is easy to open to check and/or replace the sticky pad. There are only 2 buttons so it's super easy to operate. And it doesn't look like a bug catcher at all. No one would know. So I feel it's 'flimsiness' (is that a word?) is of no concern. As long as it performs, who cares how heavy or thick it is?\n\nThis is 5 stars from someone who had to work for it. I hope this review helped you! Happy bug hunting :)",

It’s a small quiet machine with two speeds and has a UV light at the top. When you turn it on the light comes on and a quiet vacuum comes on which pulls the bugs to the bottom of the trap where a glue board is located. At first it seemed a bit sketchy but after 3-4 days I noticed a decrease in the amount of flying insects in my apt. It’s best to turn it on at night so the light attracts the bugs and it works it’s magic. There is different version that is automatic which comes on when it gets dark or you can buy the manual one. It comes with 4 glue boards but you can buy replacement boards on Amazon. I had this now for a few weeks and have yet to have to change the glue board. Pretty good product!",

        "content": "I love this little compressor ! I've already had to use it 3 times since getting it with these temperature fluctuations that seem to affect my tire pressure. It's easy to use. You just plug it into your lighter outlet, then set it to the correct measurement, in my case I used PSI. You then set it to the PSI you want, in my case 36 and then screw the hose end onto the tire valve. It will digtally display the current tire pressure. You may hear a bit of air hiss until its fully connected. You don't need to overscrew it. You will know by the hims stopping and it will feel right. Simply turn the machine on and it will fill the tire surprisingly pretty quickly. Quicker than at the pay pumps! The display will reflect the filling progress and stops automatically when set PSI is reached. You shut the machine off and disconnect the hose. Voila! Your tire is good to go! This will pay for itself in time and money driving around trying to find a working air pump when your tires are low. I am super happy I got it.",

Have been pumping a tire from 10psi to 33psi every morning for a month because I have a slow leak I'm too lazy to get fixed.\n\nSocket plug is sturdy -- I got this to replace a lesser pump whose electrical plug melted.\n\nPressure shut off works as expected. Remembers pressure setting in between uses. If you forget to turn off the pump, that's ok. Even if the pump is \"on\" when you first plug it in, it won't turn on until you turn it off and back on again. Really important in conjunction with auto shut off -- I often forget to turn the switch to off when I'm done.\n\nLight seems good.\n\nRed LED on the plug socket to let you know when it is powered -- a nice touch as my former pump didn't have this and it was a hassle to get it inserted properly.

Got another combo unit but it has analog gauge in a hard place to see and must be monitored to avoid over inflation. Which meant squatting beside the loud thing. This new pump is quieter and faster, and can be set to run automatically. The gauge seems to show the same values as my others, so it is accurate enough. Of course, being corded is less convenient than the others, and it just barely reaches the back tires on my Honda Odyssey, and has to be passed through the vehicle when switching from passenger to driver side. It is not a very heavy cord so you will need to run the engine to get more voltage for the unit to do its best. But it inflates faster than the other units I have owned, is not as loud.",

I wish the air hose could be just a little longer.\nThe air pump is sufficient enough to handle all 4 tires. Pumping from 29psi to 40psi is no sweat and only takes a couple mins if most. Its very quick. It makes some noise but what do you expect? It needs to pump air.\nI keep it inside the house during winter because of freezing temps.\nI bought 3 of these total because I've been very impressed with it. 1 for myself. 2 as a white elephant gift.\nUPDATE REVIEW 1/29/23 I've used this several times now. Wisconsin weather can get cold... I found the air attachment lever that folds over can be prone for failure to being weak and can eventually stop clamping down and will leak air during pumping air. Make sure told hold down tight before clamping it closed. And when you go store it; leave it open position. This needs to be upgraded by the manufacturer. At least mine doesn't want to clamp down anymore after a few uses. I have to push down hard and then clamp.\nIn conclusion, for the price... it does what it's suppose to do. After all, it's better than waiting in line at the pump on a freezing winter day.",

        "content": "Updated Review:\nI bought this AstroIA Air Compressor and started using it in November 2021. I used it once a month and sometimes twice a month to pump up one of my car's tires for about 6-8 minutes each time to 32 pci. By October 2022, the pump part stopped working suddenly during use even though the flashlight and display were still working. I could read the gauge, but it just won't add air. I was so disappointed because I love how well this compressor worked when it was working. Then I remembered that Amazon's page said this item includes one year warranty, and in the question and answer section the seller had said it includes a three year warranty as they are confident about this product. I decided to take the chance to contact the company via Amazon's page that lead me to their email address at support@astroai.com.\n\nI informed the seller of my issue with the product and they replied within a day asking questions and for more details. After several emails back and forth, the seller honored their warranty and sent me a replacement within a week. I was so happy that they followed up with me professionally and came through on their warranty. I have to say that even though AstroAI cost a bit more than other compressors, it is well worth it as this is a real company that backs their products. It is nice to know that you expect a good product and if anything is imperfect, the company will make it right. This company has the same quality service just like Amazon's customer service. So be confident in your purchase of this product. Go ahead and buy it with confidence.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThe AstroIA Air Compressor is the best corded compressor I have used so far as this is my third corded compressor ever used. My only complaint is that the power cord could be much longer as it is not long enough to reach all tires if you have a longer or larger car. It uses a 12v power cord that connects to your cigarette lighter in the car. However, you can separately purchase an extension cord with a transformer that connects to 12v, which is what I did that can connect to a wall outlet.\n\nThings I like are that it comes with several air pump attachments so that you can pump other items besides tires; a fuse in case you need to replace the fuse (instruction says not to use pump for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so don’t do more than one to two tires at a time); it takes around 6-8 minutes to pump up the tire; automatically shuts off if you set tire to psi you want (there are other forms of measurements in the digital display, so be sure you select “psi” for Americans); light weight; and easy to repack and put back into the box.\n\nCompared to rechargeable battery powered pumps, this is not as fast, but definitely faster than other corded pumps I have used. Other corded pumps can take 10-20 minutes per tire. Rechargeable battery pumps can do a tire in about 3-4 minutes. This pump is not as loud as other pumps, but it does make noise.\n\nThe great thing that this pump has that I did not see in older pumps is the automatic shut off upon reaching the desired psi. I do not have to stay with the pump while it is pumping. I let it pump in the driveway while I go into house away from the cold. When I hear the pump stops, I come back out to unleash the pump and turn the switch back to off before unplugging it and put it away. Even when the pump stops, the power remains on as the digital display needs power, so be sure you switch the power off.\n\nThis pump is light weight and nice looking, and easy to use. It comes with an instructional booklet that has multiple languages. They should update the compressor with a longer cord though, and it would be perfect.",

        "content": "Don't get me wrong, these are probably worth it for the $35 I paid, but its a large gap in quality between these and \"name brand\" binoculars.\n\nFirst off, they are nearly identical in size to Vortex Viper 10x42s. Build quality is definitely lacking on these, even when comparing to low end name brand binos. The pivot between eye pieces doesn't have enough resistance and if you hold them one handed the other side will droop after a minute or two, the focus wheel is also too easy to move and worst of all it has backlash. This makes dialing in focus is a bit of a nightmare, especially when looking over hilly terrain where you are constantly adjusting it in and out. The diopter adjustment moves every time you rotate the eye cups to close them in, and the over molded TPU is not affixed to the inner metal frame so you can feel it sliding around.\n\nAs for actual glass quality.... I was not able to get proper eye relief while wearing glasses as my eyes were too far away, an issue I've never had with any other binocular. If you look dead center they are fairly clear, but there is a definite vignette filter thing going on, no matter how perfectly I try to dial the diopter in. In fairness this is really only noticeable if look to the edge of the eye box which I'm guessing most people don't do through binoculars, but I like to set mine on a tripod to scan a whole treeline without moving the binos and look through a spotting scope for details, so this is a downside for me. Brightness is my biggest issue, they are realllllly bad at dusk, basically don't even bother 10 minutes after sunset. I can clearly see details for another 10 minutes through Diamondbacks/Intensitys, and then another few minutes after that when looking through my Vipers.\n\nThe case really isn't bad, its made of a rigid cloth, that actually works better than most of my other bino cases as it doesn't collapse when you put the binos in, so that is kind of nice. The neck strap would preferably be about twice as wide, but functions just fine.\n\nAll in all, exactly what I expected for the price, but nothing like what the reviews make it out to be, and perfect for what I need them for... a pair I can leave in the hunting vehicle and not be very worried about them being stolen and punishment for my son when he forgets to pack his binos on a hunting trip.\n\nIf this is going to be your only pair of binos, I would look elsewhere. Keep in mind you can pickup Vortex Diamondbacks for $100 on sale, and you get one of the best warranties out there. I ran a pair of Vortex's over with a truck, and when buying a new pair at the store I told the clerk about it and he said Vortex would probably replace them for me... sure enough three days later I had a replacement pair from Vortex and if I remember correctly I didn't even have to pay shipping.",

        "content": "I dont know a great deal about binoculars, but decided to buy my mother a “good” set since she moved to Florida and started to casually take up bird watching. Wanting to go with a reputable brand and after a few hours of research and reading, i went with Vortex Diamondbacks and had them delivered to her home. Since i was taking a trip to visit, i found these for $25 and figured I’d buy them just to see what the extra money actually got her since the style, size, and descriptions are almost identical. There is a clear difference when you compare the imagines switching back and forth. THAT SAID - the difference the extra $225 made is not nearly as large as you’d expect. Its the Ultra fine details, the edges, and sharpness/clarity of the objects at distance that are noticeable. I honestly expected to be blown away how much better the Vortex was - but i wasnt. You’d really have to be an optics guy to appreciate the small difference in image quality. I mean the difference is there, but its a very small difference. I’m CERTAIN the Vortex is a “better” binocular, not to mention the support you get from a good brand that will stand behind a product they warranty without question. They simply feel better too as soon as you pick them up - but these two brands are extremely similar in feel, style and features. Meaning, for 90% - 95% of people these would be just as good as the Vortex unless you’re REALLY willing to spend a lot more money for not much difference. So if you are an average person thats looking to buy a set “just to have them”, to bring to a football game, to enjoy yourself outdoors, try your hand at birdwatching, ect - I wouldn’t hesitate buying these. If there is any chance of them getting lost, stolen, broken, or generally beat up - dont spend the extra money. If you decide later that you wanna buy something better, than consider these as your insurance in a backup pair, or a second set to lend to a friend. You really, really cant complain about what you get for the money. The case is garbage compared to a vortex, its just a basic pouch - but it serves its purpose. These even come with lens covers - just like the Vortex - (they dont fit as well) but buying those alone separately would probably cost $10. As far as bang for your buck - from an average guys opinion, i cant see a better option than this. If i were to try to set a scale comparing them against the Vortex Diamondbacks, if the Diamondbacks were a 10 - these would be a 8.5 in an overall comparison (not just clarity). I can only imagine the difference between these and say the Vortex Crossfire’s (one step below the Diamondbacks) would be even smaller. When it comes to things like this, just like rifle scopes, small differences come at a big expense, and I imagine a large chuck of the cost for a pair of binoculars from a place like Vortex is to cover the costs of a large company and their marketing - which these dont have to pay for. At the price, (esp at the $25 i paid) you have absolutely nothing to lose. If you already have a good set, and just want a second pair - buy these. You’ll be amazed at how good these are for the money.\n\nLastly - for those who dont know what the number mean - (10x40) (12x50) - the first number is the power of the magnification (10 times closer, 12 times closer) and the second is the size larger lens (how big of an area it will allow you to see when you look through). For bird watching, experts claim the ideal sizes are either 10x42 or 12x42.. you dont want something extremely powerful, but you want something with a larger lens so its easier to find what your looking for, and keep looking at it while it’s moving (like a bird, obviously, or even a football game, Anything that can be moving at speed). A size 50 lens is physically a bigger (And would give you a larger picture) but are a larger heavier set of binoculars - so the 42 lens is a great compromise. For a easy way to think of it - to give people a rough idea, say a 12x20 you would be able to see a large bird at distance, but he may take up the entire “screen” (for lack of a better word) as you looked through those binoculars - where with a 12x45 set you would see the same bird just as large - but you’d also be able to see a large area around him. So Its easier to find him, and if he moves you can easily follow him and also see whats around him. There is not a huge difference between a 10x or 12x set of binoculars, so dont go crazy like i did. (I ordered and canceled 3 times before i finally picked what size on the Vortex). But if you were on the fence trying to decide if these were worth your money - Yes, they are. You’ll be surprised and impressed what the money got you.",

It coils up, stretches out, is hardly more than the weight of the water! Easy to maneuver because it's flexibile and light weight.\n\nI flipped the one on the front porch over a bush this summer and it came apart. The fittings are high quality brass, but the hose came apart about a foot from the spigot. I was very surprised! It is unrepairable so I had to throw it away.\n\nThe only other thing is that the hose on the deck is behind the porch swing. There is about 2 feet of space between the railing and the swing. When I turn the hose on back there, it fills up quickly, expanding in every direction and there is no place for me to step without stepping on the hose. I usually step on it about 5-6 times before I can get out from behind it all. It is not damaged yet, which is a little surprising! It seems to be very sturdy and I hope it lasts a long time yet.\n\nThe hose in the front popping open was a pretty big surprise. It is not under my feet to turn it on so I have rarely stepped on it. It has had pretty gentle care. Overall, they are pretty convenient, but I am not quite ready to spend that much again for something that lasts 4 seasons. I am trying a local hose from a reputable nursery now in the front. I can't manipulate heavy hoses anymore, so if this doesn't last, I may be back because they are very easy to use and very convenient. :-)",

But, due to a bonehead move by me, I had to resort to on line videos to remove an old hose. You see, I we had purchased an expandable hose with an aluminum female connector. Aluminum and copper don't mix nicely. I should know that, we have a boat and know about galvanic reaction. Anyway, I left the hose connected for a couple of weeks and had to hacksaw it off. I did this when my husband was not around so he wouldn't know. BAHAHAHA! He ended up knowing and was impressed that I didn't ruin the copper threads on the hose. Anyway, we had a good laugh and this time I am not making the same mistake. Should I leave the hose attached, it will not matter as the new one has copper fittings. The hose seems sturdy and does not leak. I cannot comment on it's durability as I need to use it for awhile.",

Also because it is soft and light it is so much gentler on the plants and pots it accidentally bumps into/brushes over.

Doesn't tangle, and the material it's made from doesn't harm or dirty the wood and carpeted floors it has to traverse from faucet to patio. Any other normal hose would take too much space and probably ruin our floors. Sure beats hauling countless watering cans. Actually does make having plants on our patio much more enjoyable.

The material is similar to shoe laces and takes a while to dry when it gets wet, so something to consider if you store it in the bags like we do (we use them in our RV for fresh and black rinse water). The material type also lets things like sticker burrs latch on and stab you when you're not paying attention. For this reason we stopped using them in our yard. If you have nice green grass or you have it hooked up to a faucet to water flowers this thing is perfect. It works wonderfully for our RV since we're always refreshing the tanks over concrete.

I was pretty sure that I’d spotted a runway for what appeared to be a juvenile rat/very large field mouse. Caught him on the second day plus three other house mice who came to see what was going on. It’s not an instant kill of course and you do have to drown them if you want to quickly put them out of their misery. But I figure that misery pales next to the extreme and eventual fatal pain experienced by owls and other raptors who grab a rodent slowed by conventional poisoning.\nThe problem I have with the product is the manufacturer’s instructions on this page do not match the product as delivered. “For best use, leave trap with paper on so pests can acclimate to the trap, then place glue boards along known or suspected rodent pathways.”\nMade sense to me. Only there were no papers on these traps. Instead they were inverted so sets of two were stuck together face to face. Pull them apart and the glue was already exposed. Rats especially can be suspicious, but there was no putting down these traps covered so a rat could safely investigate and grow comfortable with them before the fatal glue was exposed.\nIf the manufacturer thinks this approach is enhances the likelihood of a clean catch then the product should be delivered in a way that makes it possible.",

        "content": "There is a reason why professional exterminators use this and don't bother with \"snap traps\" - they flat out work. But there are a few things to keep in mind to make sure you get maximum effectiveness:\n\n1. You must know the path that the critters are taking. Just spend some time getting inside the head of your vermin - they have a nest somewhere and they travel back and forth to food and water sources. They will usually travel against walls and along the tops of roof joists. If you find holes in walls, you will often see a dirty smudge where their filthy little tails drag along behind them. You will also see droppings (they seem to poop constantly). Place these traps in the high traffic areas, arranging them so that they are butted against walls, and along the trails they follow (think of the way ants travel in a line - rats and mice kind of do the same thing).\n\n2. Don't bother with bait - if you follow the instructions in #1 above you don't need bait. I have never baited these things and I have caught a LOT of rats (my wife feeds birds in our yard and the seed attracts rats).\n\n3. Do NOT use these outside or anywhere your pets or children can come in contact with them. If you put them outside, you will inevitably end up with a bird stuck to it, and unless you are a cold-hearted killer, you will feel awful. When I have to use them outside (like along the pathways the rats use to visit the bird feeders) I cover them with a long pice of plywood propped against the wall to create a \"tunnel\" and try to make it much more difficult for anything other than a rat or mouse to get stuck. Also, curious house cats will OFTEN get stuck in these, especially if there is a mouse or rat thrashing around on it and squeaking. Let me tell you that it is NO fun trying to pull one of these off your cat's face while there is a live rat stuck to it (or a toddler's shoe!). Also not covering them, you'll end up with a lot of leaf litter on them, which hinders their effectiveness.\n\n4. Don't use these if you can't handle the sight of a dead (or dying) rat or mouse. Be prepared to \"dispatch\" the animal humanely once they are trapped. These traps do not cause instant death (the way snap traps do). The animal will eventually die (often from suffocation or shock) but the most humane thing to do is to kill them once you hear the squeaking and thrashing around. Speaking of which, it is fairly common (especially for a larger rat) to become partially stuck on one of these traps. I had a big wood rat get his back end stuck on one in my attic one night, and he flipped out, thrashing around and dragging it all over the place until I was able to crawl up there and \"take him out\". Outside, I usually use a shovel to decapitate them quickly when they get stuck. In the attic, I will usually use a very sharp hunting knife or a pair of lopping shears to decapitate them. (Did I mention this is not for squeamish people?). On a side note, don't leave these in the attic too long without checking them. Trust me, if you wait until you smell something funny, you are going to have a very unpleasant situation to deal with.\n\n5. Make sure you wear rubber/latex/nitrile gloves while disposing of these once you have a dead mouse/rat. The reason is twofold: first, they are filthy disease-ridden creatures and they tend to poop and pee all over when they die, and you don't want contact with that. Secondly, if you accidentally get stuck to the trap while retrieving it, you can slip off a glove easily. If you're bare skin gets stuck (and these things are STICKY!) you will have a real mess do deal with.",

Now he loves playing with the bunch because it allows for many more possibilities.\nBefore giving this gift, I wanted to test how difficult they are for a person over 60. At first it was quite challenging to create anything interesting. Then I realized that the more I try to control the process, the less successful the result. The more playful and curious I became, the more magic had happened on its own. It is a very peculiar and wonderful toy. I like the total sense of it: beautiful design; perfect size with smooth texture for easy grip; not too tight and not too loose in the joints; also they create a nice clicking sound when the cube's magnetic sides connect. So, overall it is pleasing to all our senses and helps to evolve our creative mind.\nBrilliant invention! Highly recommend.",

        "content": "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas. She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it. They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5 x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size). I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value. Well, we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in. It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square! To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing. I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together. (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday. On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it! She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there. I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in. Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it. It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult. But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else! If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self. 😜\n\nEDIT: 01/24/23 - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas. Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks. It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams. So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer. After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer. I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity. We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢",

        "content": "The birds, fish, frogs, and turtles in my neighborhood have become my new friends since social distancing began, and these binoculars have been spectacl-ar in helping me identify them. I’d never used binoculars before this new hobby, so here are some things I’ve learned that might be helpful to first-time users:\n\nBinoculars always have two numbers in the spec, AxB. A represents the magnification – the bigger the number, the more zoomed-in the image looks. B represents the size of the objective lens, which is the piece of glass at the far end of the binoculars. The bigger the number, the brighter and clearer the image looks.\n\nThey also have a focus wheel that sits between the two halves, which you’ll have to rotate depending on whether you want to focus on something close or super far away. There’s also usually an additional fine tuner on the right eyepiece that will allow you to adjust for differences between your two eyes. So when using a pair of binoculars for the first time, you should close your right eye and use the focus wheel for just your left eye, and then close your left eye and use the fine tuner for your right eye. After that you can just directly use the focus wheel.\n\nI had an old pair of Bushnell 12x25 binoculars at home before I got this Adasion 12x42 set. Here’s a comparison, with things I learned from experience:\n\n1/ Size: The Adasion is bigger because of the larger objective lens. You can see the size difference in my first picture.\n\n2/ Eyepiece: The Adasion has eye cups that rotate in and out, which give your eyes some breathing distance from the eyepiece lenses. You can see in the second picture the right eye cup has been extended while the left one has not. The Bushnell didn’t have this feature, so my eyelashes were always brushing against the glass, and the glass itself would frequently fog up.\n\n3/ Straps: This seems like a trivial one, but it bothered me more than I expected. Bushnell’s straps attach at the center, while Adasion’s straps attach on each side. This results in the Bushnell hanging somewhat perpendicular to my torso, which makes it really annoying as it bounces along while I walk. The Adasion just lies comfortably flush against my torso.\n\n4/ Protective covers: You can see these in the first picture. Each objective lens has an individual rubber cover that hangs off the end. If you don’t like them, you can remove them – they’re attached by a rubber ring that slides off easily. But I think they’re great and protect the glass from smudges. The eyepiece lenses have a joint cover that you take off completely; I only put it back on when I’m done for the day.\n\n5/ Picture quality: The most important difference. You can see four pictures I took through both binoculars. Interestingly, I found that the Bushnell binoculars were very slightly more magnified than the Adasion. I actually prefer the wider field of view of the Adasion, which is more forgiving of unsteady hands. The Bushnell also starts to get blurry on the edges (see the fence and bench or the floating grass in the fish photo), while the Adasion is much clearer throughout. In addition, colors are a lot brighter through the Adasion, while the Bushnell is a bit faded.\n\nThis brings me to my last piece of advice: the smartphone adapter is pretty cool. I had no idea what a phone adapter was in the beginning – I assumed it was some kind of USB cable that digitally connected the binoculars to your phone, and you’d have to download an app or something to take pictures. Nope. So apparently, you can just hold up your phone camera to the eyepiece of any binoculars, have your phone “look” through the binoculars (monocular?), and you simply use the camera app to snap whatever your phone sees. It works surprisingly well as an amateur telephoto lens. That’s all I did to take the pictures from the Bushnell.\n\nTurns out though, it’s kind of hard to hold the binoculars in one hand, your phone in the other, and both steady enough while maneuvering your thumb to snap the photo. It’s flat out impossible to take video. So the purpose of this phone adapter is to make it easier by holding your phone in place. It’s a very simple piece of hardware with a spring-loaded clamp around your phone (both an iPhone 6s and iPhone 11 fit just fine) and a round cap that attaches to either of the binoculars’ eye cups. For best results, attach your phone without the eye cups extended. Righty tighty all the way. I find that provides the optimal phone-to-eyepiece distance for the best view from the camera.\n\nI also did some extra research on phone adapters and tried to buy one for my Bushnell. The universal circular ones have a screw cap where the attachment can be expanded or contracted in order to fit any eye cup. But I actually found that the screw mechanism made the attachment so thick that my phone camera was too far away from the eyepiece to see much through it – all I got was a small hole. In contrast, the adapter that comes with the Adasion was built to fit the Adasion eye cups perfectly. It’s a nice snug fit so your phone (even a heavy iPhone 11) will stay in place at just the right distance from the lens and without needing any hand support.\n\nThe last thing I’ll say about the phone adapter is not to be surprised that your picture is a circle in a black vignette. That makes sense, since that’s what you see when your eyes look through the binoculars too. The rectangular photos from other reviews can be produced by either zooming using the camera’s zoom function or just cropping after the fact.\n\nOkay that’s as much as I’ve learned so far through my amateur explorations, hope you’ve found it helpful. :)",

I didn't plan to use them that much but there have been times I wanted to have them.\nI ran across these an put them on my list. I didn't really care about the phone adaptor part but figured I might at some point.\nAfter getting them I was surprised. They work well. Tried the phone thing and it's ok but really about the same as any other adaptor. It IS a bit flimsy and wobbly. Just because the attachment to binoculars is plastic. Once steady it does ok.\nThe binoculars DO have some pretty upscale things usually only found on High dollar binoculars. Like coatings, lens, etc. So that was cool.\nI wear glasses and it was really a nice surprise to see adjustable eyepieces for with or without glasses.\nI would have to say I'm pretty pleased and it looks like the warranty iron clad if I understand it.",

I use them primarily for night skywatching, but also for looking at wildlife and landscapes. The images I see are quite bright and have great color. I looked at a half moon and Jupiter last night. Was able to see the Galilean moons around Jupiter (you need to be in a nice dark place and have a good way to steady them for that), saw really cool details of mountains and craters on the moon. I even saw some moons where the foot of the mountain was still in the dark but the peak was already in the sun, very interesting view that looked like the peaks were floating.\n\nI used to have a 12\" Dobsonian telescope, but for being able to get a quick view without hauling out a lot of gear, I like these even better. Highly recommend them for casual use.",

I can read the back company name of a van that is parked one block away - not the license plate, but the words that are appx. 10 inches high. I feel for this price range - currently under Sixty dollars, that these are an amazing deal. If they become too heavy, that's when I know I need to go up in price tier to over 100.

        "content": "Great for baths for little ones and has multiple perks to it. Not only makes bath time fun but it has rings to put on the tentacles which is great for motor skills and development skills. Also great for teething little ones and helping break through those painful little teeth. Extremely adorable and not only fun for toddlers my 4 and 6 year old love to play with as well. Very gender neutral and cute. Could make a fantastic gift or toy for a young child and is very easy to clean up and doesn’t have no problems with colors fading or coming off so not a concern for the kiddos chewing on the rings or tentacles. Highly recommend and very affordable! Make your kiddos bath time even more fun by adding this little toy! Extremely satisfied with this purchase!",

        "content": "This is a review of the Gskyer 80 mm refractor telescope. I am not an employee of Gskyer, I am an astronomy hobbyist. I have 3\nother telescopes and a spotting scope. My review is based on this background and is a fair and honest assessment of the package both for daytime use as a spotting scope and as a night time astronomical telescope.\n\nThis is an entry level 80 mm short focal length refractor telescope/spotting scope package. It includes the optical tube assembly (the telescope), a mount/tripod, three eyepieces and a 3X barlow. Based upon my tests, it works well during the day as a spotting scope and at night as an astronomical telescope. The simple operation and stable mount make it an good first scope. The included eyepieces and barlow give it a good range of magnifications. Its compact size would make it a good “grab and go” or travel scope for someone who has larger telescopes.\n\nThe Mount – This is a shining feature of this package. The tripod/mount of the Gskyer 80 mm is solid, stable, easy to direct and does a good job. Many entry level telescopes have flimsy and wobbly mounts/tripods making the telescope difficult to aim and resulting in a shaky image that is difficult to focus. The mount of the Gskyer 80 is an outstanding feature of this package. Note that it uses a dovetail attachment for the optical tube which means that the mount could be used with other optical tubes or other dovetail mounted accessories in the future. It also includes a standard 1/4 20 stud on top of the mounting rings which can be used to mount a camera or other accessories. The finder scope uses a standard dovetail mount so other finder scopes could be used. This is a level of flexibility you don’t typically see in a package at this price.\n\nThe Optical Tube Assembly – This is what you might normally think of as the telescope. The OTA works well and presents a good image. In side by side comparisons it compared well with my Meade 80 mm scope. The focuser is easy to use and includes a 45 degree correct image diagonal that presents the correct image that you would want when using this as a spotting scope during the day. This also works well at night when you are comparing the sky to a chart as things are in their correct positions in the eyepiece. The scope uses the 1.25” standard that is most commonly used for telescope eyepieces, diagonals and filters so you can easily add accessories in the future.\n\nThe included finder scope works well. The bracket is sturdy and provides ample adjustment so that you can align it with the optical tube assembly. Note that you will need to focus the finder when you first take it out of the package. This is done by turning the front black part. This is easy to do and will only need to be done once, but it is not mentioned on the assembly sheet.\n\nYou will have to align the finder with the optical tube. This is a normal procedure required on any telescope and is best done during the day. Find a target as far away as possible, but at least 500 feet away. I like to use the cross arm of a telephone or power pole. Using the 25 mm eyepiece, center the cross arm in the eyepiece of the telescope, not the finder. Now use the two black screws on the finder to move the cross hairs till the target is centered in the cross hairs. You are now aligned. This is very important for use during the day and at night. You may have to make a minor adjustment from time to time but that is normal.\n\nEyepieces – The included eyepieces present good images and are well matched to the scope. A nice touch is that they are threaded to accept standard astronomy filters which will help improve your view of the Moon, planets, nebula and other targets. The eyepieces, when combined with the included 3X barlow, provide 16X, 40X, 48X, 80X, 120X and 240X. For daytime spotting scope purposes, the 16X and 40X are good choices. If the air is very quiet the 80X works well too, but it is the atmosphere that will limit the magnification, not the scope. For night time use, typically an 80 mm scope will max out around 140X to 160X, but don’t hesitate to give 240X a try on the moon. Just remember that atmospheric transparency and turbulence will be the limiting factor rather than the scope. And, because the Gskyer 80 mm uses the popular 1.25” eyepiece size, you can add single focal length or zoom eyepieces, diagonals or filters of any brand.\n\nWhat can you see with this package?\n\nDuring the day I tested the scope by focusing on the leaves of a maple tree at about 150 feet, about half a football field. I was able to see the veins in the leaves without difficulty. I have not taken it to a shooting range but I would expect it would do well for target practice. At 800 feet I was easily able to resolve leaves on the top of a tree as well as a bird perched on a branch. Many spotting scopes use zoom eyepieces so I tested it with the included eyepieces as well as my 8-24 mm zoom eyepiece with good results.\n\nAs an astronomy telescope it did well compared to my other 80 mm scope. The mount is easy to direct and the focuser made focusing easy. It worked well on Mars, Saturn and the rings,the Moon and star clusters. I expect it to work well on Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and its moons, stars, star clusters and double stars. I have enjoyed the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades and other deep sky objects with an 80mm telescope.\n\nTo a large extent what you can see with any telescope will depend on your ground and sky light pollution levels. I live in a very light polluted suburb of NYC. Even under these challenging conditions, in addition to the Moon and the bright planets, there are hundreds of star clusters, asterisms and double stars within the capability of this telescope. At a darker site, the range of what you can see greatly expands. That would include galaxies and nebula that would be challenging from a light polluted location for any telescope. Don’t expect things to look like the pictures in magazines. Those are produced with long exposure astrophotography, often have false color added, and do not represent what you will see through the eyepiece of a telescope many times larger than this one.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a compact, easy to carry, easy to use scope that can serve as a spotting scope during the day and an astronomical scope at night, the Gskyer 80 mm refractor should serve you well. And since it uses the standard 1.25” eyepiece and diagonal size it will let you add eyepieces, filters, diagonals and other accessories in the future. You can also take photos or videos through the eyepiece. You can hold the phone up to the eyepiece but there are attachments made for “digiscoping” with 1.25” eyepieces that make this a lot easier. Or add an eyepiece webcam to project the image on a screen or enter into the world of planetary imaging.\n\nIf you are looking for a scope for a tween or teen that they can use on their own, this would work. A smaller child would need help setting this up but a 10 year old can likely handle it on their own.\n\nYou should have a lot of fun with this scope.",

        "content": "I bought this knowing nothing about telescopes and not knowing what I could expect to see through this thing.\n\nNow I know more, I think this is a decent value, but it comes with A LOT of cons.\n\nIn telescopes, the aperture size matters much more than magnification. The bigger the aperture, the better the image will be. This is a 70mm aperture (2.75 inches), which is about as small as you can get. It's typical for an \"entry-level\" telescope, and a decent value for the money if you want to get into stargazing without dropping 500 bucks or more on a bigger scope.\n\nHowever, if I could do it over again, I would've spent more and gone with a better one.\n\nFirst, as with all beginner telescopes, it is actually much harder to use than a more intermediate level one. This is something well-known in the amateur astronomy group I've joined, and they never, EVER recommend buying a beginner telescope, ESPECIALLY for kids.\n\nBecause most kids like looking AT stuff more than looking FOR it. And with this telescope, far more time is spent hunting for objects than actually looking at them.\n\nMy kid doesn't have the patience or attention span for that, but I rather enjoy the challenge, so I do it. Which brings me to the next problem.\n\nThis is made for kids. As such, the stand is very short. Which means that all the time you spend hunting for things, you'll having to be hunched over, crouched down, or kneeling on the ground.\n\nAnd if you live in a place with a lot of light pollution, you won't be able to see much more than stars, the Moon, or the brightest planets. Even Mars is difficult to see through this telescope, and you can't make out any detail whatsoever on the surface.\n\nYou can make out SOME faint detail on Jupiter, especially if you go away from light pollution on a clear, moonless night. And you can just make out Saturn's rings.\n\nVenus, on the other hand, is very easy to see. Especially now, near the end of April 2020, it is the brightest it'll be all year, so we've been looking at it every night. It's too bright, even at its dimmest, to make out any detail, but you can see what phase it's in.\n\nGalaxies, most nebulas, and many star clusters are beyond the ability of this telescope, but that being said, I was able to see a planetary nebula called The Ghost of Jupiter last night.\n\nFor perspective, I've had a few weeks of use and practice, and feel comfortable with the telescope, and have a number of apps, charts, and star maps to help me find things, and it STILL took over an hour for me to finally find it, put it close enough to the center of my field of view to use with max magnification, and put it in focus.\n\nAnd even then, it looked like a hazy, bluish star. We couldn't make out any detail or the distinctive eye-shape that can be seen with even slightly larger scopes.\n\nStill, it was cool and the kid loved it. I consider it worth the effort, but my back is killing me today.\n\nDon't get me wrong, for an entry-level telescope, this is good. It'll serve our needs while we save up for an upgrade. But, like all entry-level telescopes, this is harder to use and not powerful enough to see much.\n\nAll the time required to hunt for things, for what many may consider a disappointing result, could potentially end up killing a kid's enthusiasm.\n\nIf you absolutely MUST get an entry-level telescope, this is a good choice. But if at all possible, save up and get a larger aperture.",

        "content": "I bought this as a gift for my grandkids and the intent was to allow them to witness the \"Christmas Star\", the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn on December 21. The plan was to capture the event nightly from December 19 through December 22.\n\nReceiving and unboxing the telescope was pretty straightforward. The instructions were somewhat trying, but given that there were only a few \"moving parts\" it was easy enough to figure out. The only problem we encountered was that the adapter for allowing the telescope to connect to a smartphone was missing half of the adapter and we could not connect a phone to the telescope. No idea why the part was missing. We unboxed the telescope on our dining room table and when we discovered the part was missing we had no less than 5 adults searching for it, to no avail. We didn't lose the part, we just never had it. That was disappointing when you consider that being able to attach a phone was one of the primary reasons for selecting Gysker and we lost our opportunity for the grandkids to record their witness of the grand event.\n\nSetting that bit aside, the telescope worked wonderfully. It was easy to set up, with all of the [available] parts fitting nicely into the supplied carrying case. We transported the telescope to our observation area and the telescope set up easily. The 'spotter' scope allowed us to get on target quickly and the aperture and zoom features allowed for a spectacular view, including many of the moons surrounding the planets. We even used the spotting scope and a smartphone app to align the telescope with other stars for equally breathtaking views and we spent about 2.5 hours searching out various objects in the night sky each time we went out. (From dark until bedtime).\n\nThe grandkids (10, 9 and 7) really took to the telescope, learning how to use the various parts and functions rather quickly, even to the point that they could select and observe a star on their own. The tripod was solid and held a stable image and everything, sans phone adapter, worked very well.\n\nIf I was rating just the telescope on cost to function-ability, I would rate the Gysker telescope 10 stars. It is a very good telescope for the money and since we wanted the kids to get excited about the night sky, this was a great purchase. The ONLY disappointment was because I specifically chose this telescope because we could attach a smartphone to record an event that only happens every 800 years and then was unable to do exactly that, well, it was a real letdown.\n\nEven at that, I would tell anyone wanting to start amateur exploration of the sky that this is still a great telescope for the money.",

I like that I’m able to drink the smoothie directly from the blender container.\n\nI don’t know how long it will last now that I’m using it pretty much daily but at the price it is, I wouldn’t expect it to go on for years and years.

        "content": "Arrived today, so I cant yet say how strong the thread is (I will add to this review if any problems arise), but it is a decent little kit - for the price - for taking on vaca for small jobs. Referring to some points made by other reviewers:\nyes, the thread coils are quite small. But they appear to have more than enough thread to do a few simple jobs each. And there are two each of black and white, and three of light beige, which somewhat compensates for the lack of length. You will eventually need to buy more thread. By small jobs I mean re-attaching buttons, hopefully sewing a hatband onto a felt fedora (why I got it), but I wouldn't expect it to sew up a large rip in pants. As to difficulty in opening the case with the needles, there is a tiny piece of hard-to-see transparent tape securing it in place. This must be removed. After that, the black back piece is pretty easy to remove from the transparent part that actually holds the needles. When you remove that back piece, make sure it is/was on the top side, and hold the case perfectly flat, so no needles will not fall out even if the \"hole\" happens to be aligned with a needle \"slot\". Assuming needles dont start falling out, look at the side edge of the transparent part (it is opaque in places, but not the black backing.) You will see a gap at one point. To remove needles you need to rotate the transparent piece until the gap is over the \"exit\" slot for the needles you want to use. It is fairly difficult to rotate, use two opposing thumbs to turn it. Keep the whole thing level horizontally while you are turning the plastic, because whenever the \"gap\" goes over an \"exit slot\", if it's not perfectly level a bunch of needles will fall out.\nAs a beginner, the hardest part is getting the thread into the needle. This kit comes with two threaders, which help a little but its still difficult for an old fogey like me with shaky hands and non perfect eyesight to do. The biggest help for me is this very useful device I got somewhere a long time ago, maybe at a surplus store, a jewelers loupe (?) which is a thing with a strap that goes around your head, a little light, and a strong magnifying glass that goes down over you eyes. That brings intense magnification to bear while leaving your hands free. But you probably wont take that on vacation, so, get a pair of strong reading/magnifying gasses (get them at a dollar store, they are way too expensive elsewhere). Also, the thimble is a ring with no top, which may actually be more useful than a regular one since I push the needles with my finger tip, not the top of my finger. We'll see.\nThats a pretty long review for a $7 item, and I will add to it after I actually try it.\nOK,adding now after first use, sewing a hatband onto a felt hat. First, the thread is weak. It broke on me once when pulling through the felt. Thread is fuzzy, obviously not a strong polyester. Also, I was wrong about their 'ring' thimble being OK. A real thimble works much better. You get what you pay for.",

I only gave it 4 stars because I have to remove my rings when I shower now because shampoo and conditioner get caught up in between the adjuster and my ring and it's a pain in the rear to clean out. I usually never remove my jewelry because it's real and clean them often anyways, and partially because if I never remove them, I'll never lose em.

Read on if you'd like my personal reason for liking this tape or stop here and just understand I think this tape is great.\n\nI purchased this to fix a child lock on a lever style door. I have a 32 pound dog that likes to jump up and open the doors with his paws like a little human. Fun, right? Except when you're changing, going to the bathroom or just need some privacy. The adhesive on the lock itself eventually wore off, maybe with his weight constantly pulling the lock down for so long. I bought this tape, applied, didn't like where it was, peeled it off, reapplied the same piece (crossing fingers it would stay sticky) and it has held up for almost 3 months now with him tugging on the lever. It doesn't fall down, it didn't leave any marks or damage when I peeled it off the door. I've since used it on walls to hang small decor and a thin mirror. It's just a new staple for me and the cost in incredible for how much you get. Forget a command strip the rest of my life. I'm keeping this tape",

Well, I personally think that it's easy to manage and easy enough to remove. It doesn't just peel off when you remove it, but it does so cleanly and gives the resistance you would want from something you expect to work correctly.\nWhen I first touched the sticky part I didn't think it would handle the first task I bought it for. It just didn't feel very sticky and I had a difficult job for it. I have an HDMI switch I wanted to adhere to the back of my TV. 5 cables curve away from it right after their connection therefore putting a lot of strain on it not allowing it to lay flat. It held and held superbly! I ended up replacing the switch today and wow, it holds great! I plan on buying lots more of this in the future. Highly recommend.\n\nThe way I used it was to stick it to the back of what I was using it on as I unrolled it and then with a good pair of scissors cut it and pressed it in. Then just remove the strip and put it on the surfaces. I pressed and held the first time since I wasn't yet sold on it, but today I pressed it and walked away confident that it was there until I chose to remove it. Great stuff!",

        "content": "I purchased this AGLUCKY countertop ice maker almost 4 months ago. I live in a small lakeside cottage and the kitchen doesn't allow for a refrigerator large enough to contain an ice maker. Keeping up with ice cube trays, especially when entertaining, was a challenge I was just done with. I also don't have a lot of counter space but since this unit has a fairly small footprint, I was willing to at least test sacrificing counter space in exchange for giving up ice cube trays.\nWhen I bought this, it was on sale. Even so, I hesitated to purchase it because several 1-star reviews stated it stopped working after 30 days and customer service was non-existent. Seeing several of the same 1-star complaints is always a red flag to me. But - Because of the price and because of my total annoyance with ice cube trays I took the plunge. I am happy to say that almost 4 months in and we are still going strong. I use this regularly 1 -2 times a week. I fill it and make a full \"batch\" of ice cubes and when done, I leave the lid open to dry out and unplug the unit until I need it again.\nThe ice cubes are very wet so if used directly out of the machine they are not long-lasting cubes and if placed directly into an ice bin in the freezer they become a big clump. To avoid this, I keep a gallon zip lock bag in my freezer and each time the basket is full of ice, I empty it into the bag and lay it flat in the freezer. When the next batch is ready I shake the bag to break up the cubes, dump them into the ice bin and repeat the process. One complete fill of water in the ice maker makes enough ice to fill the ice bin in my freezer. When I have the amount of ice I need, I open the lid and unplug the unit until next time. While the whole zip lock bag process may sound involved to some, to me it still beats dealing with ice cube trays. I unplug the unit only because that is the manufacturer recommendation for my Vitamix and it just makes sense to me to not run electronics when not in use for long periods of time.\nThe \"cubes\" are only about 1/3 the size of a regular ice cube. The size is nice for filling water bottles and for cocktails. And yes, it really does make ice cubes within the promised 9 minutes. Of course, it isn't a great number of cubes but is ice in 9 minutes as advertised.\nI am very very happy with my purchase and have recommended it to several of my friends. I would definitely buy again.",

I've been without an ice maker since I moved into my current home where the new fridge is without an ice maker. Yes, I realize I could just use ice trays, but I have a teenage child and guess where the trays are every time I want ice??? Yes, you guessed right, the trays are empty, on the counter, or in the freezer with no ice in them. So after getting tired of that situation I got an ice maker.\n\nThis device makes ice in about 9 minutes. I fill the water reservoir every few days and it keeps us supplied with a nice flow of ice. I use filtered water. So far I've had no trouble with it. It's not very noisy, and you can turn it off when not using as long as you don't mind waiting 10 minutes when you want the ice.\n\nHighly recommended.",

No more. This little appliance has in action since I received it and it is so easy to place in a convenient location and ice is always ready. I haven't noticed a difference in taste but I also refill it daily with water because I use a lot of ice. I have been using it for over 2 months with no issues at all. The only sound is when the cubes drop into the basket but that also happened with the fridge ice maker. I am very pleased with this wonderful gift.",

I read a lot of reviews before buying. People saying ice is sorta wet when it comes out. The ice is a little wet. What I do is take basket out, shake over sink, then dump into ice container in freezer. After about 5 min I open freezer and break ice apart ( very simple) with some kind of sturdy plastic utensil. I do this till my ice container is full. Then you are good to go. The ice is very easy to break apart and stays apart. So for that tiny inconvenience I get fresh Ice whenever I want it. And I use bottled water because we our area has sulfur water so can't use it for ice.",

It makes just the right amount of ice for me to fill my Stanley before work, and I have ice for when I get back. I like that even when the ice in the tray melts, the machine just recycles the water and makes more ice. It’s not super noisy either, I catch it every once in a while, but only if I really listen for it; otherwise it’s just typical background noise and not noticeable. Definitely recommend for people with limited freezer space who go through ice quickly like I do!",

So I had to buy the ice maker to have ice.\n\nPros\n1. Easy set up\n2. Makes ice cubes fast\n3. 2 different sizes of ice cubes\n4. Sound level isn’t that bad. Only when it’s putting the fresh ice into the basket do you hear anything.\n5. Low energy. I make ice in the day and put the ice in an ice bucket in the fridge then I turn off the ice maker.\n\nCons\n1. Ice cubes are small and hallow from inside which means they melt fast and will water down your drink\n2. Have to keep an eye on the ice tray because it “fills up” fast and you need to empty the ice cubes before the machine makes more ice.\n\nConclusion: great product. Easy to use. Does the job. Good price",

This one seems legit, has the serial number on it, security tag, and was in the right packaging. Also came with the microchip that is supposed to reset the fridge. I installed the filter started to purge the filter, the water came out black at first like it's supposed to and tastes like it should. The only problem is the microchip wouldn't reset the message on my fridge. Called GE, they told me to go to Home Depot or Lowes to buy a new one. Did that, the and the message is still up on my fridge to reset the water filter. I called GE and explained all of this to them, they are now sending me out a new water filter claiming that the batch of microchips is probably faulty. Beware before you buy a fridge that requires these water filters. I still don't know if these filters are legit or not for sure.",

I bought this to use around the house so I didn’t have to get out the big, heavy Shark every time there is a small cleanup somewhere. Just had to buy the AC to DC cigarette lighter Converter to charge it in the house and it holds a charge impressively long. Comes with all the tools to get in those hard to reach spaces like between the oven and the cupboards, underneath the oven and around the trashcan with the crevice tool extension. I haven’t really used the brush much, but it seems perfect for cleaning off baseboards. Filter is easy to clean out(even comes with a second filter) and handy carrying case for travel. Only thing that would sweeten this deal is a wall mount to charge it(and if it came with the AC to DC converter plug to charge it).",

        "content": "I wish I would've taken a before and after picture! You'll just have to take my word for it. So initially I was skeptical of this vacuum because of its small size. I noticed there were TONS of reviews though, mostly decent, so I decided to pull the trigger on it. I have a messy toddler and am about to have my second baby, so the idea of being able to plug it in right in my car and do some cleaning, was really appealing. I also really like the idea of having different attachments for cleaning nooks and crannies. I decided the other night to get it out and give it a shot and I'll say, initially I wasn't overly impressed. I plugged it in and turned it on (yes, with my vehicle running) and thought, \"wow, that's it?\" But when u started vacuuming with it I was actually pretty impressed. So NO, you're not going to get industrial vacuum-quality with this device. However, like I said, if you want to be able to take your time at your own house and so some car cleaning, this device is great. It actually did a pretty good job of cleaning my carpets and giving my car a refresh. I loved that the attachments helped me get into spaces I'd never have access to with the vacuum at the car wash. So between the counsel and the seats, etc. The hose in my opinion is shaped oddly and doesn't work too well, but I loved the brush and the straight attachments. The hose plugs in one way to the vacuum and then faces a different direction at the end, so it's pretty uncomfortable trying to straighten it out to fish it down into a nook. Not bad, though. Just personally won't be using that attachment as much. I like that it includes a brush for the filter and an extra filter. What I did find annoying was that the suction power was lacking if even the smallest amount of dirt and hair stuck to the filter. So I felt as though I was constantly emptying the dust cup even when I should've been able to fill it up more. Lot of dirt and particles like to stick right around the tip where it sucks, right in the crack between the opening and the outer plastic. So that was annoying, but holding it facing up and giving it a few good taps sent the dust down with the rest of it by the filter which was good. I did notice that when you open it and take the filter out to dump the dust, the rubber ring on the filter gets dusty and makes it difficult to seat it back into place within the plastic so you can click that back onto the actual vacuum. So tinkering with that was pretty annoying trying to get it to seat correctly so I could get back to vacuuming. It took me quite a while to complete but my car also hadn't been vacuumed in a while. All in all, I would say this is a really good but also flawed device that is nice to have if you don't like having to go to the car wash to clean out your car, or you have small and messy children like I do and want to be able to clean up after them in a pinch and at home. This device as I mentioned earlier is also quite good for the nooks and crannies the car wash vacuum heads simply cannot reach. However if you're expecting professional detailer-quality results, you'll likely be disappointed. This vacuum does have pretty good suction power but some stuff that is almost weaved into the carpet fibers still remains. It is not perfect, and i would say it's not quite as professional quality as the claims state on the box. It also claims you can clean wet messes with it, however I have not tried that as of yet and am not sure I'd be comfortable testing that. So, all in all, if you're looking for what i described, you should definitely get this product. However if you're looking for something more professional grade, you may want to look into something a lot more powerful. I am happy with the value of it, and hope to get a lot of use from it.",

        "content": "I've never really had a problem cooking rice on the stove, so I never felt I needed a rice cooker. I was concerned about taking up extra space in my cabinet for a device I didn't need. I had heard so many good things about this particular rice cooker, and the price was so reasonable, I thought, why not give it a try?\n\nWell, I have to say this is a handy little device. I like the peace of mind of setting and forgetting. I have made 3 batches of rice now, and each one came out perfectly. The first time I followed the instructions, I rinsed the rice, put in the water, stirred and turned it on. About 25 minutes later, perfect fluffy rice. The second time, the only change I made was using chicken stock instead of water. Again, perfect fluffy rice. The third time I was in a hurry, so I tried the rapid rice function. According to the booklet, I was supposed to have cooked rice in 9 minutes. I didn't have rice in 9 minutes, it still took 20 minutes. I had forgot to rinse the rice first, so it was a little sticker, but still perfectly cooked. I need to go back and make sure I didn't miss any steps in the rapid rice process.\n\nThe book comes with recipes, you can make complete meals in this cooker. I haven't tried the steaming options yet, but you can steam veggies and proteins as well, even while your rice is cooking. I will be experimenting with that function in the future. You also have the ability to cook other grains, which I also have yet to try.\n\nI would like to mention, you can cook rice quicker on the stove than in this rice cooker. The real advantage here is the hands off set it and forget it peace of mind. Most meals that I would be making to go with rice take 20-30 minutes to prepare, so the fact the rice cooker takes longer isn't an issue for me.\n\nI did purchase the smaller size cooker option because I don't make large batches of rice at one time, but there are larger size options available. And finally, yes you can cook rice in an Instant Pot, but if you have your meal cooking in there, you can't cook both at the same time in the same device.",

        "content": "We own a large 60 cup, party-sized Aroma Housewares rice cooker and love it, so we decided to give this small 8 cup a try.\n\nGrowing up in an area where white, sticky rice is served on the daily, you become a rice cooker connoisseur early on. Having owned pricey cookers and cheapy cookers of nearly all the popular sizes and makes, I've learned that the only things that matter are 1) is your rice cooked firm and chewy; 2) is it easy to clean; and 3) does it cook enough to feed your family. This pot met all these criteria for us as well as taking up very little counter space while looking good in steel & black. At 1st glance we thought, \"this is the teeniest pot we've ever owned!\" but it really does cook 8 full cups of perfectly done rice - translucent and slightly sticky. (We don't eat fluffy, softer rice like Uncle Bens).\n\nWe rinsed and drained completely 4 cups of raw rice (rice measured to the cup brim and used a colander to drain) then filled the pot with cool water to the 4 cup line in the pot. Doing so matched the Thumb Measuring rule (lightly touching the top of the raw rice, water should reach 1st digit). We were pleased that the lines are clearly marked in white. Using the \"white rice\" setting, the pot began its 10 minute count down after 25 minutes for a 35 total minute cook time. There was no wait time after cooking was complete. This review is based on the Sam's Club Members Mark Thai (Hom Mali) Jasmine Rice, a long grain. We have not tried our other favorite brand which is Hinode Calrose White Rice, a medium grain, but I suspect it will need a bit more water, probably filled to the 8 liter mark, and will need at least a 15 minute wait for the rice to set before serving.\n\nWe have not tried the \"warm\" setting for rice since we unplug the pot as soon as its done, serve it, then refrigerate whatever is left. I will use the warm setting occasionally for broths. I also plan to cook bulgar using more water than rice on the \"brown rice\" setting. The \"delay\" setting works well for jasmine rice presoaking, then cooking on flash rice. Probably won't use it for steaming, but you never know...\n\nThis cooker serves 3 persons well. Fast and easy to clean with no sticking. We also like the white speckled black pot - that's a first for us. We've had the pot for a day and already tried two recipes. Very useful thus far!",

        "content": "I've been making rice on stove for years and finally decided to get a rice cooker. Oh man this is a game changer! It makes the Peeerrrrrfffect rice! Best rice I've ever eaten, even better than the ones I got at some of my fav. restaurant! It's compact and doesn't take much counter space. It's extremely easy to use with preset settings for making steamed rice, steam veggies, or heat things up. It can make soup, porridge and many other things in minutes! Oh it also looks very cute with this compact size. I'm soooo happy with this purchase. Just to clarify that I'm one person, so I got this size which is perfect for 1-2 people for regular use. For a family with kids, this would be a tab small. But for single or a couple, this is perfect.",

        "content": "I love the size. It’s lightweight and easy to store and doesn’t take up a lot of real estate on the counter if you prefer. It’s not only great for cooking grains but the steamer basket has proven to be very convenient to steam vegetables and/or fish/meats while grain is cooking. It probably works best for up to 2 people as far as the steamer goes. The instruction manual has instructions, not only for your grains, but also for steaming and cooking meats and vegetables. It also has some recipes for oatmeal, frittata, jambalaya, french toast casserole, chili and pasta. It even has a delay start and flash cook for rice if you’re in a hurry and it keeps warm when cooking is done. The outside stays cool to the touch & the whole thing is very easy to clean. It was definitely worth the price.",

        "content": "I've had Aroma rice cookers for decades and, overall, they're reliable kitchen workhorses that produce good consistent results. This newest model, the small white one with limited functions, is no different. My issue is the blatantly erroneous claim that this model accommodates \"4 cups raw\" and \"8 cups cooked\" rice. That's a bold-faced fabrication. \"Cups\" refers to the puny plastic measuring cup that arrives as part of the kit and that provided cup is equivalent to approximately 1/2 a US measuring cup. The rice cooker pot looked precariously full with just 2 cups of uncooked white rice and the 4 cups of water required for cooking. Upon cooking, the rice was cooked perfectly but was overflowing the pot, requiring cleanup. In summary, Aroma rice cookers are sturdy efficient machines but beware the capacity touted online as it's only technically true because they've created their own measuring system. The unit preforms well but it's tiny and not suited to making quantities of rice for large families, parties, or extra rice for storage and use later. If making a little less than 2 standard US measuring cups of rice in one go, the product performs well. However, the be aware of the dinky size of the thing because, in this case, a cup is definitely not a cup.",

        "content": "I've use my Rice Cooker a lot to make about 1 to 2 cups of rice and have been very happy with the Aroma branded cooker because of its small size, ease of use and cooking speed. Using it is so simple; add rice, water and start the cooker.\n\nA couple things disappoint me. The first, I seem to only get about two years (ARC-914D = 2 yrs, 1 week this time, previously I had the ARC-914SBD) out of them before I have to buy another. I know it's time to replace when I have to restart the cooking process because finding too much water and uncooked rice in it after the first attempt. Restarted the cooking process will make good rice, and that's' when I order a new one. The second issue; some times it will sort of burn and leave a clump of gelatinous rice at the bottom center of the cooker. I know too much starch can cause this, but pre-rinsing the rice couldn't prevent this from happening. I discovered if I coat the non-stick surface with an little extra olive oil spray corrected this issue 100% without altering the taste of the rice. I purchased another ARC-914SBD; and pick between models based only on which one is cheapest at the time.",

        "content": "I bought this AROMA brand rice cooker to replace a larger vegetable steamer (by a different manufacturer) that had an attachment for cooking rice. I wanted to have a cooker that was primarily for rice, with the option to steam vegetables and/or cook other foods, while being smaller when stored on the countertop, and easier to clean than my old one. Based on other Amazon reviews, I selected this one.\n\nBefore I forget to write it, I think it is important to point out that this cooker is rated for 8 cups of COOKED rice, NOT 8 cups of uncooked rice. The usual ratio for regular white rice is 1:2, meaning that if you put in 1 cup of uncooked rice, you will have 2 cups of cooked rice when done. So with this product you can put in a maximum of 4 cups of uncooked rice, and will end up with a maximum of 8 cups of cooked rice.\n\nIt is also important to note that if you choose to use the optional (included) vegetable steamer/food cooker tray, this fits inside the rice cooker pot and therefore takes up some of the space in that pot; you can cook rice AND steam vegetables/cook food simultaneously, but you cannot fit the full measure of rice when doing so. In my estimate, if you put in a cup or two of uncooked rice, the vegetable steamer/food cooker tray holds about enough to feed two people when combined with the rice. It is certainly not large enough to simultaneously cook rice and other food in quantities for a family; AROMA makes a similar product with a larger capacity if you need it.\n\nI shopped in several stores (Sears, Bed Bath & Beyond, Target, Macy's) before buying this cooker. They all carried electric rice cookers, but none had this product. Sears has AROMA products, but only in a less expensive non-digital version, while BB&B had a similar cooker by West Bend that did not look as good in terms of quality. But the majority of places I looked carried only non-digital rice cookers. I mention this because I think the digital ones have a couple of advantages that are significant enough to comment on:\n\n- The cooker is not simply based on cooking time; there is some sort of measurement going on that assures properly cooked rice.\n- The cooker can be programmed to start cooking while you are away, so that the rice (or other food) will be ready when you want to eat it.\n- The cooker automatically goes into a 'keep warm' mode once cooking is done, and will work well in this regard for at least a few hours.\n\nThis cooker includes the following:\n\n- Cooker itself (included the digital controller and the heating element)\n- Teflon coated (non-stick) rice cooker pot\n- Plastic vegetable steamer/food cooker tray\n- Plastic stirring spatula (used once rice is cooked)\n- Clear plastic measuring cup (1 cup capacity)\n- Users manual\n- Quick start guide\n- Rice recipes\n\nBasic rice cooking goes like this:\n\n- Measure uncooked rice, using included cup or any other measuring cup\n- Pour rice into pot\n- If cooking white rice, pour in some water, stir with included spatula (or wooden spoon, etc), drain water (this optional step helps rinse away excess starch)\n- Add water to pot (which already contains rice) until water level reaches measuring mark on inside of pot that corresponds with amount of rice\n- Close cooker lid\n- Press POWER button\n- Press either the WHITE RICE or BROWN RICE button\n- Cooking starts, and is monitored by the digital controller; display shows rotating LED pattern, 'Cooking' LED illuminates\n- When digital controller estimates that about 12 minutes remain, display stops rotating pattern and starts showing count down minutes until done\n- Cooker beeps loudly for a few seconds, automatically enters KEEP WARM mode, 'Keep Warm' LED illuminates\n- When ready to eat, press POWER button twice to turn cooker off, open lid and remove pot\n- Stir cooked in pot using included spatula (or wooden spoon, etc)\n\nThe manual includes a chart for estimating cooking time, but in general white rice takes 20-30 minutes, and brown rice takes twice that time.\n\nI have done small and large batches of both white rice, brown rice, and also a batch of wild rice, and all came out perfectly, properly cooked but not mushy. White rice had a nice level of stickiness of the sort that lends itself to eating with chopsticks, but without being TOO sticky, so you can easily break it up by stirring more with the spatula.\n\nIn my tests, I always used the recommended water amount (i.e. I filled the pot to the measurement line that matched the amount of uncooked rice I put in), EXCEPT for the wild rice; the cooker does not have a setting for wild rice, so I followed the instructions on the rice bag, putting in 1-3/4 cup of water for each cup of uncooked rice, and then using the BROWN RICE mode on the cooker.\n\nI have not used the optional vegetable steamer/food cooker tray, so I cannot comment on that very much. But the manual includes extra steps for setting up cooking in the tray only (i.e. no rice cooking), as well as simultaneous cooking of rice and other foods. There are ways to specify time values that apply to the foods in the optional tray, so the cooker is not going only on its normal method for rice-only cooking.\n\nBesides using the product for cooking rice, and other things in the optional tray, it can be used as a sort of 'crock pot' for heating soups, chili, stews, etc. In this case, you just put the food to be heated into the pot directly and select the WHITE RICE mode. The food will be heated and then the cooker will keep it warm until you are ready to eat it. I tested this using a can of chili, and it worked well. This use of the cooker is mostly useful if you want to program it to start cooking while you are away, with cooking completed soon before you ARE ready to eat, OR to keep the food warm if you are uncertain about when you will be ready to eat.\n\nThe pot is easy to clean. Since neither water or food are ever put into the body of the cooker, there should rarely be any need to clean it, other than wiping the inside of the lid in case any food splashed up onto it during cooking.\n\nThe quality of this product seems very good. Nothing feels cheap. My only quibbles are that the power cord is quite short (obviously intended for use on a counter top, whereas I prefer to use it on a table that is further from the nearest outlet), and the 'control panel' area is quite reflective, and sometimes I have to view from different angles in order to read the buttons and/or the display and other LEDs.",

There is a removable top plate you can pop off and rinse after every use. The lining keeps the rice from boiling over. There is also a little removable plastic container to catch the steam droplets that you should to empty and rinse after each use.\n\nThe most I have cooked is 3 cups dry rice (about 6 cups cooked), which is more than enough for the 4 of us, including 2 teenage boys. I could probably fit an additional cup of dry rice.\n\nThere is a function called flash rice which cuts off about 5 minutes or so from the cooking time, not sure why it's not the default setting. I normally just use the white rice button.\n\nThe non-stick surface is granite like. I prefer it to a smooth surface, I find that the rice and starch seems to cling less and releases easier, making for simpler clean up.\n\nMy only complaint is that the countdown timer only comes on towards the end of the cooking session. Given that it's not that reliable to begin with, not a big deal, just plan for about a half hour for cooked rice.",

The under lid removable piece is very flimsy and I bent it slightly trying to remove it to wash. It also does not integrate with the gasket very well after washing, you have to slid the gasket into it’s place with your fingers. Hopefully, the button the under lid attaches to will loosen up as time goes by. The thing I found most annoying is the lid is hinged on the right side of the appliance as you face the control board. If you are right handed, as I am, when you raise the lid to stir your food the back of your right wrist will bump against the lid unless you turn the appliance to the right. My Sanyo had the hinge in the rear which makes more sense, this design is awkward for stirring although if you are left handed you will probably be delighted. Nice cooker for a very reasonable price, my Sanyo was $100 more than this one.",

    "description": "Product Description\nWARNING! - NEVER use any chalk markers on chalkboard paint or cheap porous chalkboards.\nHow to get started.\n\n1. Shake well before each use. These nontoxic, water-based markers need to be shaken thoroughly before use to mix the pigment. We recommend shaking the capped marker until you hear the ball move freely (30 seconds to a minute). If you don’t hear the ball moving inside, remove cap, press marker tip down once to release pressure, replace cap, and then shake again. Be sure marker is tightly capped and hold your finger over the cap while shaking to avoid splatter. Test flow before re-shaking.\n\n2. Prime the marker.\n\nOn scrap paper gently press the bullet tip until you see the color reach the base of the nib. Once full, further pressure will cause the marker to leak and puddle.\n\n3. Prime your chalkboard.\n\nBe sure to prime your non-porous chalkboard before use by rubbing regular chalk the board and then wiping it off with a dry paper towel or rag (if you don’t have chalk on hand, you can substitute with corn starch or baby powder). Remove liquid chalk marker with a wet rag or paper towel.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nBold, bright, and fun liquid chalk markers from Bandle B. Perfect for adults and kids, this pack of 8 markers offers lively colors. Ideal for businesses, crafts, events, and every day. Write a note, write a message, draw something pretty, or sketch something silly. Let your imagination run wild with a rainbow of colors that are fresh and beautiful.\n\n\t\n\nPerfect for hand lettering and freestyle designs, Bandle B. Liquid Chalk Markers come in 8 vibrant colors to help your designs, messages, and slogans pop off of chalkboards or whiteboards. These markers are easy to use and erase.\n\n\t\n\nThe Bandle B. Liquid Chalk Markers are the perfect way to do it. For use in your home or business, the vivid colors create eye-catching designs on your writing surface to make a lasting impact.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ'S)\n\nWhat do I do if the color appears faded or watery?\n\nIf the color is not vibrant or appears runny, this means the pigment is not fully mixed. Just shake the marker with the cap on until color is opaque and vibrant.\n\nWhat if the tip gets stuck?\n\nIf the tip gets stuck, take off the cap and partially unscrew the colored plastic piece that attaches the nip to the black body of the marker. A couple turns will do the trick and when you tighten this piece back up, the nib will pop back into place.\n\nHow do I reverse the tip?\n\nThese markers come with reversible tips. Simple use a pair or tweezers or a paper towel to pull out the tip, reverse and replace. Use a piece of scrap paper to press the tip in and release to ensure the tip is fully set.\n\nI haven't used them in a long time, how do I revive them?\n\nif the markers go unused for a while or seem to be drying out, they may need a little attention to get going again. First, shake it vigorously for at least 30 seconds. You need to hear the ball bearing moving inside as you shake it. Keep shaking vigorously for at least 10 seconds after you hear this sound. Now prime the nib by fully pressing it down on a clean surface. Hold it down and/or pump gently until the ink comes out.\n\nCan I use these markers on chalkboard paint or a painted wall?\n\nPainted boards are not recommended for liquid chalk markers as ghosting will occur. Ghosting is when you can still see a faint outline of your drawing even after erasing. We recommend sealing any non-porous surfaces before using markers.\n\nHow do you erase liquid chalk markers?\n\nOur Liquid chalk markers can be erased easily on non-porous surfaces. A damp cloth is usually all it takes. However, on porous surfaces (non-erasable), some of the pigment can get absorbed, causing a shadow to be left behind when removed. If you've experienced this, here are some ideas to help: 1. Use a white cleaning eraser to clean the surface. These work wonders but can remove some painted surfaces, so please test first. 2. Use a baby wipe. These also work well and are somewhat less aggressive than cleaning erasers. Please test any of these cleaning techniques in a small area first as all surfaces react differently to these solutions and we don't want any damage to occur.\n\nWhat else can I use my markers on?\n\nThese markers also work great on vinyl, glass, whiteboard, tile, metal, plastic, and other non-porous materials.\n\nWARNING! - NEVER use any chalk markers on chalkboard paint or cheap porous chalkboards.",

I didn’t start using these regularly until 4 months ago and I write a monthly calendar with them to keep track of my schedule. 1 color I rarely use is already barely working unfortunately despite shaking and priming multiple times. The markers have always been kept in the box they came in and are stored upside down. I had hoped I wouldn’t have to prime them each time I wanted to write down a new appt quick but that’s not the case unfortunately. As you can see from the attached pic, I take care of them so it’s not like they are battered and bruised! Even though I’ve had them for over a year, I would’ve hoped they would’ve lasted a little bit longer given the fact that I didn’t really start using them until recently. I’ll be looking for a different for future use.\n\nThe colors are good once you get the marker primed well. Some of the colors tend to be a little bit liquidy which makes it a little bit of a pain to get the chalkboard clean if you are particular like I am. I imagine there are better markers on the market yet these do work if you put a little extra effort into it.",

They were an excellent purchase and serve that purpose extremely well as his bedroom flooring is hardwood.\n\nDislike: They do tend to come apart fairly easily. As someone who frequently visits the gym, I would not recommend for the gym. Basic exercise such as yoga or stationary movement, they would work quite well. The matting is soft and very comfortable, but for a gym floor I'd want the connectors to be a bit stiffer so that they didn't come apart so easily.\n\nMy rating is based on my intended usage, not as a gym mat.",

        "content": "First - I ordered 48 tiles and only need 24 tiles. Was not sure how I was laying out the room and set it up in a \"L\" shaped layout - worked and looked great. Installed in seconds / minutes. If I damage any or something happens, I can swap out a tile in seconds. Seems to hold together well and if dense / firm, but cushioned. I was using carpet on a concrete floor as my cushion and it was hard on the knees and any floor exercised.\n\nInstalled these and what a world of difference. Again, firm but still a slight cushion. I use the FITBOD app and it takes you through weights to bodyweight to bands so you are all over the equipment. Only used a couple of days but loving them.\n\nNow the drawback - I thought it was because I cleaned / washed the painted concrete floor in the basement that it was slippery when I stepped onto it from the mats. Went upstairs and stepped on the tile in the kitchen and noticed a slickness on my socks that made me walk cautiously like I could slip. There must be a some type of mold release product to allow it to come out of the molding process when they are made. Let me be clear - the mats, when on them, especially with shoes did not seem slippery to me. They are textured and noticed no slipperiness to them. It was stepping off them on the painted surface I noticed it. I am going to try wiping down with a window cleaner or car interior surface cleaner that has no shine to it to see if will cut the transfer down. Still recommend them highly.",

Because it is packaged in a rolled up position not only is it a pain to straighten into a flat position but the edges are also distorted. Some of the red tape protecting the adhesive does not touch the adhesive due to a linear object being forced to curve.\nI unrolled the sweep and placed it on a flat surface with a weighted object on top for a few days. This helped, but the edges were still crooked when I installed it. The installation wasn't difficult, but it looks a bit sloppy because I could not make it level due to the shape. The adhesive seems like it would adhere well if it wasn't for the curves that remained. I tacked it to the door for a couple of days to ensure the adhesive stuck.\nSince installation, the product works great. It is exactly as advertised.

It’s soooooo worth it!!!! Our water tastes great now, no weird flavor at all anymore. And the best part is that over the course of 6 months (the life of the filter) it will actually end up saving us money since we don’t need to buy bottles anymore.

If that is accurate, the price seems alright considering the alternatives.\n\nChanging out the first filter on my fridge was painful. However, it is relatively easy to put the new one in. You are supposed to flush out a couple gallons of water before you start using it. If you notice particulates in the water, it's possible you haven't flushed enough water through the filter.\n\nTaste has been great. I was surprised to notice neutral flavor in the water that came out. Did not have any tap water taste to it. This is a great replacement to using water bottles. Average human drinks 8 cups of water per day. If you only drink bottled water, you are spending around $18 a month, which translates to over $100 for 6 months (Yes, I did the math lol). Since this water filter costs around $50, you are definitely getting your money's worth.\n\nOverall, while this filter is more expensive than others, it does a great job and for a long period of time.",

        "content": "I recently purchased the Chemical Guys Professional Grade Premium Microfiber Towels and while they are good, I haven't found them to be any different than any other microfiber towel I have used in the past. They are soft and absorbent, and safe for use on my car, in my home, and for drying my pets. The size of 16x16 inches is a good size for most tasks, and the pack of 12 towels provides a good value for the price. However, I haven't noticed any significant difference in quality or performance when compared to other microfiber towels I have used in the past. If you're in the market for some microfiber towels and you like the brand Chemical Guys, then these towels might be a good choice for you. But if you're looking for something that stands out from the crowd, or for better value, you might want to consider other options.",

If you love your car, then never touch it without lubrication. Using your dry finger, even your cotton t-shirt, can scratch clear coat. So never touch your baby without lubrication. After you accept that, and realize to avoid scratches, you want to use microfiber towels. I've used these towels and they work very well. Rip off the tags of them to prevent them from scratching the paint. Spray your favorite lubricant on these to wipe any extra residue off the car. I use Ammo products. I won't use any other towel than these on my car, and my car is IG worthy. I am on IG. But I don't like using IG, nor TkTk, because those apps will literally make you lose IQ points if you spend too much time on it. If I ever need any more of these great microfiber towels, I would definitely purchase them from this seller.",

        "content": "These work great to remove wax from your car. After applying the wax and allowing it to cure for a few minutes, use the microfibers to buff out the wax. The plush, absorbent side is good for wiping stuff down, but use the other side to remove the wax. They last a super long time if you clean and take care of them. I don’t recommend them for cleaning heavy dirt, because it will stain them. It’s more of a finishing towel for light cleaning after you do the wash and dry with other towels.",

        "content": "I really like most aspect of this lamp, except for the timer.\n\nFirst the good....\nThis lamp is very sturdy and has the Best gooseneck that I've every seen on a lamp. It is NOT the limp gooseneck you see on other lamps where you place the lamp in position, then it slowly Wilts like a dying flower. NOPE! This has a strong firm gooseneck that stays PUT exactly wherer you position it. If you're using this for plants, this is a must because you need exact positioning to illuminate your plants so they will get the light they need. This lamp WILL ALLOW that Perfect Placement so your plants will thrive.\n\nThe clip is very strong is should solidly attach the lamp to a table, shelf, or other surface the the clip can grab. I was suprised at the heavy duty clip. You should never have any attachment problem with this lamp.\n\nI purchased the 50 watt version. I was suprised at how BRIGHT this lower wattage version really is. Glad I didn't order the 100 watt because it would have been too bright. Even with 50 watts, you must turn away to keep it from hurting your eyes.\n\nSeller Customer Service is GREAT. My first lamp was defective. The selleer answered my query immediately and shipped a new lamp right away. I had the new lamp in only a few days. The seller is exceptional in customer service.\n\nNow for the Negative....\n\nThe timeer function.\nThis timer works, but it may not work as you expected.\nIn product description, here is how the timer function is described:\n\"Timer Function & Multiple Settings - this growing light offer the circular memory timer function with 3 options-4h/8h/12h. When keeping power, it can automatically turn on and off every day according your settings, no more manual operation for you.\"\n\nI expected that whatever time period you set would be repeated an an ON/OFF cycle forever (until you remove power from the lamp). NOT TRUE!\nWhat I expected is that once you set the timer the lamp would but ON for the timer period, then OFF for the timer period, then ON for the timer period... etc. etc. etc.\n\nThis lamp doe NOT work this way!!! It is based on a 24 hour cycle from the time you set the timer. For example, if you set a 4 hour timer it will turn ON immediately for 4 hours, then shut to OFF.\nIt will remain OFF for the next 20 hours until the next day when the time that you set the timer rolls around. Then, on Day 2, it wil burn for 4 hours then turn OFF.\n\nEach time period you select on the timer function will ONLY turn ON for that period ONCE every 24 hours. The cycle is 24 hours. It does NOT cycle ON and OFF per the time period you select on the lamp.\n\nIf you select 4 hours, it only turns ON for 4 hours per 24 hours.\nIf you select 8 hours, it only turns ON for 8 hours per 24 hours.\nIf you select 12 hours, it turns ON for 12 hours per 24 hours.\n\nThe lamp turns ON starting at the exact time when your originally set the timer.\n\nI would have otherwise given this lamp 5 stars, but had to knock off a star for the weird operation of the timer function. Now, I probably would not have knocked off a star if the product description in Amazon had actually EXPLAINED how the timer works. Even the instructions that come with the lamp do NOT explain that the lamp operates on a 24 hour cycle and will ONLY burn ONCE per 24 hour period..\n\nOther than this lack of explanation on the product page and the same shortcoming in the included instructions, this is really a great lamp and will earn a Five Star rating from most buyers.",

The clamp is great.\n\nMy only complaint is the timer. It works fine and as intended but I hate that every single light on the market like this comes with this exact same timer which limits the ability to be plugged into a smart switch for use. When turned on, you can set the time to 4, 8, or 12 hours - so for now I set mine for 4 hours starting at 8:30 am and it does this consistently every day just fine. In the event that that schedule doesn't work for me and I need to alter it, I basically have to reset everything and start all over again. This light is in the living room so if I'm watching a moving or something and wanted to turn it off due to how bright it is, yup, starting over again. I wish there was a timer-free option for this listing. I would buy several more of these.",

I’ve had plants do ok for about 1-2 years but for some reason this year they all gave up and started looking really bad; no longer thriving. This grow light, while not the most beautiful addition to my home decor (next time I’ll get a white one so it doesn’t clash so much with my furniture), has been a great help. It did take a few weeks of daily use to see much improvement, but my plants eventually started looking better and even new leaves have appeared that had not grown in years! The Chinese money plant in the photos lost 75% of its leaves and I was so excited to see new babies forming. I’ve been rotating the plants too so the leaves look even, as they do start angling towards the light! The instructions don’t make it clear, but this light will also turn on at the same time each day on its own, so you don’t have to worry about going on vacation!",

        "content": "We have a lot of plants that we usually keep on our porch during the summer. With winter coming, we knew that we'd have to bring them all inside. While some of these plants are kept close to windows and tend to get enough sunlight to keep them going, that's not the case with some others. For those, we needed lights. I stumbled upon this unit during my search and decided to order one just to see how well it would work.\n\nOur light was delivered right on time, and within a few minutes of opening the box we had it casting a glow over one of our most struggling plants. Not much to the light, really: there's twin flexible rods that can be bent in order to direct each light to where it's needed, and those rods stay in place very well. The rods are anchored to a plastic clip, much like you'd find on a small desk fan. This clip has a firm hold with non-slip pads on the gripper, and gives you tons of options for where you'd like to position the light--not happy with where you put it? It's very easy to move. The power cord terminates in a standard USB plug, and comes with a wall adapter.\n\nThe power switch is located on the cord itself and comes with a few features. Of course there's the standard on/off positions, but there's also a dimmer: you don't have to use the light at full brightness if you're using it on a plant that prefers indirect sunlight. There's also a built-in timer that's pretty convenient, if a bit limited. You can use this timer to run the lights for 12-hours, say, after which the light will turn itself off, then turn itself back on after 12 hours of darkness. There's also four-hour and eight-hour modes if those suit your needs better. Losing power, at least on the unit I tested the idea with, will also lose your timer settings--so it might be a good idea to use a programable timer instead. However, at this price point, it's hard to complain too much about what is still a nice touch.\n\nThe light produced is a clean and crisp white light, despite the presence of dedicated red LED diodes. Your plants will get the spectrum they use the most while you'll be able to appreciate their natural beauty. When I saw some of our leaves \"reaching\" for the bulb after a few days, that told me all I needed to know about whether the lights were going to be effective. I ordered a second set, which was also delivered promptly and has identical build quality.\n\nNow there's a third set on the way.\n\nSo yeah, I recommend them!",

This was exactly what I needed. They are thriving now.\n\nBest part is, you can plug this into basically ANY USB port. Even one on your computer if it comes down to it.

The lights are really bright and the timer makes my life much easier with my work schedule. Supper easy to use, compact and cost effective. One thing I was originally concerned about was not having enough red LEDs but they are more than strong enough especially for your big leaf plants.\n\nThings to note:\nWith the brightness comes heat and as you all may know heat and LEDs don’t mix and these lights can get pretty hot. So to preserve the light, I try to keep a fan near by just to cool the lights off a bit. I also lower the light intensity so it isn’t at max all the time. (Disclaimer: The heat has not caused any issues at all and only doing this to preserve the LEDs.)\n\nReally happy with this purchase and plan on buy another one to grow my collection.",

Hopefully it stays!\n\nMy husband got me two sets of these lights for Christmas to cover four shelves on the bookcase where I have my plants for winter. I set them up on 12/27 and was initially very happy with them. A few days later I had the chance to play with them and apply the timers, so I had them set to turn on and off together. On 1/11 I noticed one had not come on several hours after it should have, so I turned it on manually and set it for the same amount of time. 1/12, that light again did not come on with the timer, but when I attempted to power it on manually nothing would happen. I have unplugged, moved around, jiggled, etc but it will not come back on. I hope this is a fluke because the other one seems to work just fine so far deposits being shipped together, plugged into the same power source, and experiencing all the same conditions, but fluke or not, failure after just two weeks of use is very disappointing.",

It can also be caused by tree sap, road tar and other foreign substances collected on either the glass or the blade.\n\n\t\nSplitting\n\nSplitting is caused when the sun’s ultraviolet rays penetrate the rubber squeegee, causing it to breakdown and separate from the frame.\n\n\t\nSqueaking\n\nSqueaking and chattering occur due to normal wear and tear or extensive use. A bent frame can also be the culprit as the frame has inconsistent contact with the glass surface.",

I was helped by people in the comments.\n\nRainX needs to leave BOTH adapters loose in the pack. Getting the first off and then adding back the second was a nightmare. One came off easily, the other took 20 min and a screwdriver (and preying I didn't break them. My hands hurt so bad. I had to use leather gloves to pull and push on the sharp metal parts.\n\nThen there was actually figuring out how to get it on the hook. I got there eventually but I think I spent 45 min on all this! Now that they're on they are working way better than my old warped set. I still see a dash of streaking but it goes away almost immediately. Hopefully won't be a big deal.\n\nHot tip: before you throw away your old wipers, swipe the squeegee down with rubbing alcohol over and over until the cloth becomes clean. So much gunk will come off and they'll work way better. The gunk adds to the streaks.",

I was able to replace it easily without turning off the water and didn't have any leak but it doesn't appear to make ice anymore... I did notice that old filter was much heavier than this new one and I'm guessing because it collected minerals and other stuff inside the filter. I will have to figure out why it's not making the ice anymore but it does seem to be authentic and genuine filter and I didn't have any water leaking problem after replacing it as other people have indicated...

I was extremely worried about that and when we got a new Samsung refrigerator I was dreading the time when the filter needed to be replaced. I went so far as to try and find sellers that could verify the production code on the side of the filter so I can make sure it's the exact same production lot as the filter that came with our refrigerator. It's possible to do that but not easy. I looked at the reviews of this listing and took a chance. Much to my satisfaction the filter was an authentic Samsung filter and came with the authentication sticker on the box and on the filter. It fit perfectly in my refrigerator and installed in seconds. If you have a Samsung refrigerator, I do recommend following the instructions to shut off the water so there's no pressure because it does make the filter harder to install. Bottom line, this listing sells genuine Samsung filters and will work with your refrigerator. I recommend you buy it from Amazon versus a third party seller that might be offering it for slightly cheaper.",

        "content": "Back in the 20th century we all relied on jumper cables and the help of a neighbor or friendly stranger to jump start our dead battery from their vehicle. It worked, but was not without issues. How long before someone came along who was willing to help? Did ether of you have a long enough jumper cable in your car? Was your battery accessible to connect to the other vehicle? How dangerous was it to rely on strangers to help?\n\nWell it’s a new century and the technology has greatly improved. With the Noco series of small and powerful jump start power packs we no longer need the help of another vehicle. If our battery is too weak to start the car, a simple, safe, and foolproof option is waiting to help. Just attach the cables to the battery. There will be no sparks because the Noco has no electricity flowing until you turn it on. And you can’t make a mistake. If you connect the cables to the wrong battery terminals, the Noco will not send out power and will alert you to your mistake. Once correctly connected, just turn on the Noco power button. It tests your battery and itself for voltage. You will see a display of lights telling you how much reserve power the Noco has available to jump start the car. If it can’t make an accurate determination, just press the boost button to force the Noco to use its full potential. Now that was easy. So, just sit in the driver’s seat and turn the key to start the car. If you don’t have other issues, like being out of gas the car will roar to a start from the strong power coming from the Noco. Let the car run while you turn off the Noco, disconnect the cables and store it away for the next time it’s needed. Under most circumstances, you should be able to jump start a car up to six times before needing to recharge the Noco from your home wall outlet.\n\nThe main reason to buy this product is that it greatly empowers you to solve a weak or dead battery problem. No need for others to help. No waiting, you’re back on the road again in minutes. This model, the GB40 is suitable for most gasoline cars. Consider a larger capacity model for diesel engines, trucks, and locations where sub-freezing temperatures are the norm.\n\nI have had a Noco jump start battery pack for eight years. It has never failed me. I’ve stopped and helped many stranded drivers along the roadside. I’ve given these as gifts to family and friends. They are safe, reliable, and easy to use for any driver without the need for any automobile knowledge. If you can find your battery, you can get back on the road all by yourself in minutes. As the title says… DON’T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT.",

        "content": "Edit:\nI made it back out to the farm and the ATV battery was still dead. I hooked the jump starter to it and this time pressed the override for a few seconds and it did go into override mode. The ATV did turn over and I eventually got it started with a little assist from some ether. Updated to 4 stars.\n\nOriginal review:\nI have owned this jump starter for a little over 4 years and only needed it a handful of times. It is so strange when it'll work and when it won't. In trying to recall the times I needed it, one was the same year I bought it, 2018. A fill-in pharmacist we had that day went to leave after her shift and her car wouldn't start. I had come back to the store to get something, so I offered to help. I don't recall what it was, maybe an Acura or some other foreign branded car. It would not start her car, so I pulled over my ugly truck and used jumper cables and got her going. I've used it on a couple of riding mowers OK. A woman was stuck in the parking lot where I worked, ended up her alternator was shot so it did no good to jump her car, however, it did work after several tries. It was a small SUV like an Olds Bravada I think. This past fall I tried using it on an 04 Artic Cat 400 ATV and it wouldn't even try, nothing. The unit wouldn't let me even do the override function. Then we come to last night (Dec 22) and it was crazy cold. It was -9F with a wind chill of about -33F by 6pm. I go to start my truck and it could barely turn over then nothing. I grab the starter and figure I'll try it anyway. It took a couple of tries but it actually started and I was able to get home with frozen fingers, super cold. I plugged it in after several hours of warming to inside temp and the 100% bulb was the only one flashing, so it was still mostly charged.\n\nI have kept it charged up, so I don't believe that to be the cause of not working in the past. I don't know if it's a vehicle issue with some sort of safety in the vehicle side, but why wouldn't it start an 18 year old ATV, your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps I didn't press and hold the override button until it engaged, I'll test that again.\n\nI recommend buying a case for it to protect it from getting activated when not needed, and it's a convenient way to store the starter, cables, USB cable, and car charger adapter all in one place. Mine is by a company called Khanka. A quick glance didn't show it being sold anymore but there are other kinds available.\n\nIt allows charging of other items like you would with a battery bank and has a flashlight with several different modes. I like that it comes as a small package and mostly seems to work except the couple times it didn't. Perhaps there are other, possibly more reliable, options out there but not sure if they could be this small. Thanks for reading!",

There may be something cheaper in Amazon that is supposed to do the same thing but it is hard to believe that there is anything better.\n\nVery easy to get the car running\nStep 1 charge GB40 for about 3 hours in the house with USB charger (First time charge)\nStep 2 plug in the terminal clamps to the GB40\nStep 3 Connect to terminal clamps to battery and power up GB40\nStep 4 When GB cannot detect completely dead battery -- press override button on GB40\nStep 5 Start car\nStep 6 turn off GB40 and disconnect terminal battery clamps.\n\nThe back story if it matters -- My 2007 Mustang GT is in the garage all winter under the cover -- there is a small phantom drain on the battery from some electrical circuit in the car -- very difficult to track it down. With this said, I have a device that should prevent the battery from being drained below starting voltage (Priority Start). The Priority Start device works 100% of the time during the summer and I'm very grateful to have that as a safety net while driving the car around town -- winter storage not so much.",

Went to start car this morning during a cold snap (<0°F) and the battery just didn't have the juice to get the car started. Car had been sitting for a few days prior. Pulled this out of the back seat verified it had a full charge and connected to battery. This initially did not have much effect. Verified terminals attached correctly, verified the box had power and noticed what started as full power was now showing about 75% brought it inside and charged it back to full power for a few hours (during which time Temps climbed to 10°F), reread instructions and realized maybe to try the boost option if needed. Once fully charged attached to battery before making an attempt to start and let sit for about a minute. Car started right up without even having to utilize the boost. Moving forward during the colder months I may keep it inside and just toss it in a bag when leaving to use the car as it did seem to work much better once warmed up a bit",

        "content": "I was very skeptical about this item when I ordered it, but I had burned out my battery charger and needed a more reliable alternative. Since the beginning of COVID and with working remotely, my car time has been reduced by 90%, and when you're not using your car often the battery tends to lose its charge. Factor in the very cold weather we have had recently in Texas and if you are not starting your car at least every other day and circling the block, your battery is going to die on you. And always when you need to be somewhere in a hurry.\n\nThis jump box is very compact and easy to use. The first time it didn't work and I figured I had just lost my money. But after reading the instructions (imagine that), the device may not recognize you've hooked it up to a battery if the battery is completely flat and won't make the circuit. Pushing the override button solved the problem and the car started up immediately.\n\nSo far this winter, I have had to use this twice and both times the car has started without any issues. And the jump box still has a full charge on it. This is the best investment I have made this year and plan to give out as gifts to family members for that \"just in case\" moment.",

My 2005 Ford Escape truck had a completely dead battery. I had not used it in two years. I followed the directions I found on YouTube and my truck started in less than a minute. I was so happy I drove it around ( I knew I had to because of the battery being so depleted.) but I also was just happy to be riding in it again. I confess while filling the tires I even bragged to a stranger about the charger. He asked me about it and was amazed when I told him. I bet he will be buying one. I can honestly say I never used anything that was so easy to charge a truck/ car battery. I highly recommend!!I can tell you rarely do I give products I have bought this much praise. You will not be disappointed. I am so impressed I can barely contain my enthusiasm. I am taking my beloved old truck to my mechanic so I can once more drive “ her” around and smile.

Our local temps can be anywhere from -10 to 110 depending on time of year. Seeing some of the questions that were posted for this, I wouldn't suggest just leaving it in the car all the time no matter the weather, unless it's mild.

She had an electrical problem in an old Suzuki, and has used it on a weekly basis to jump start that vehicle (I've replaced it now, with an Accord). As I explained to her, keeping a lithium battery in your vehicle is not a good idea, they like the same conditions you do. They don't like cold or extreme heat, they like the same temperatures you do. She kept it in her purse, and as I've indicated, used it on a regular basis until I gave her my old Honda Accord. The Honda also has a battery that is really too small (weight savings for fuel economy, it is after all lead). She once again had to use it when the Honda battery died, and pulled it out and after 6 years and hundreds of uses, started first try. NOCO did a good job with this, don't leave it in your car, and it won't let you down.",

I planned on carrying it around in my pocket and only putting it on when I went outside to do work. That all changed when I put it on and saw how perfectly it fit. I thought it was going to look all big and clunky but it actually looks so good I just left it on. All the buttons still work perfectly and I didn’t lose any sensitivity when swiping on the screen. They drilled little holes for the speaker so it didn’t lose any sound quality. They also drilled little holes in all 4 corners so the mics in the watch can still hear your voice commands. It is a little harder to roll the crown up and down but the push sensitivity stayed the same. That is probably my only complaint about this watch cover that I can think of but there’s not much the manufacturer could change to make it more accessible and still be protected. If you are looking to fully protect your Apple Watch Ultra I would absolutely recommend this watch cover vs just getting a screen protector. Even though this watch is titanium and has sapphire glass it will still get dinged up if you watch YouTube stress tests people have done on it. I want to keep my watch looking as brand new as possible and this cover gives it complete protection.",

        "content": "Since I dropped my previous Apple Watch, and the glass shuttered (and I didn't get any money back when I purchased a new watch), I reluctantly started using a protective case. The issue is that, with the case, we lose the superb touch sensitivity which makes Apple Watch awesome. I tried a few cases before, but this one is by far the best among what I tried so far, in terms of touch sensitivity. This is the first time when I feel like I can use Apple Watch as if there is no protective cover. The only think I wish it were different is that I wish the edge of the screen not as sharp (not too sharp but not round either) and mimic the round form of the original touch screen. We'll see if it is scratch resistant, or how well the case protects my watch (I have been using less the a week so far), but so far I love it.",

Helimix's graduated scale markings on the side of the cup range from 4 to 20 ounces. With the lid on, filled to the brim, Helimix can hold 28 ounces of liquid.

Helimix uses an innovative patented design to ensure every athlete's sports drink mixes smooth. The shape of the cup itself does the mixing and it works way better than you think.

I would always get clumps with my old shaker bottles. And my old bottles, no matter how quickly I'd rinse/clean them out, would hold onto odors from whatever protein/liquid I would put in them. Some of my old bottles would hold onto lingering scents so badly that I'd end up throwing them away!\n\nWe've used our bottles several times since we've bought them and I haven't noticed any lingering smells! These bottles are also so easy to clean. I just put in a little dish soap, some hot water, shake it up, and done!\n\nHOWEVER... The lid can be really difficult to open. That's good because it makes it much more difficult to experience leaks but like another reviewer has experienced, when I've opened my lid I accidentally crushed one of my fingers under the \"key ring\" side of the lid. It hurt like HECK because I had to push the lid open pretty hard! I don't want to deduct a star however, because this is still a really excellent product. Just gotta watch the placement of your fingers when opening the lid.",

        "content": "When I made my buy, I did not take the time to read the reviews or even consider the advantages and disadvantages of the product. I wanted to try it, and I saw this one, and it was reasonably priced, so I only thought twice before purchasing. This steamer would be a good investment for people like me who do their laundry to ensure few wrinkles; however, no matter how hard you try, you will always have a wrinkle here and there. And this steamer is small but works miracles when it comes to those tiny wrinkles. It is travel friendly, easy to store, and compact. I am satisfied with the purchase because I knew it was something other than what I would use daily. There are instances when a minor crease in my clothing makes me lazy about getting out the iron and performing all that extra work. I did not need it for anything significant, in other words.\n    \n     I was excited to try it when it arrived, so I did. At first, I was frightened because there did not appear to be any steam coming out, but after 3 minutes, I saw smoke, so I recommend giving it some time after being plugged in to get it operating. I had never used a steamer before and was highly pleased. It contains enough water to complete at least one outfit. To avoid water spurting out, don't fill it up. Be cautioned not to put your hands or skin too close to the blue nozzle because this machine part gets hot. Despite being portable and simple, I tried a steamer because it doesn't leave wrinkles and lines like an iron. And just as expected, the steam did wonders for me in removing wrinkles. I also used the included brush, which worked equally effectively both ways. Although it works wonders, I would not suggest it to someone who plans to use it frequently because it is time-consuming and doesn't work as well on oversized clothing. This isn't to say that it doesn't work, just that you must review it a few times to get it to look exactly right. However, this is ideal if you're looking for something inexpensive, convenient for storage, and simple to use. Remember that it works best on smaller clothes because it will take less water, and you can get a lot done with one full cup. If you wanted to steam more than one piece of clothing at a time, you would have to stop often, turn the machine off, and let it cool down for a few minutes before adding more water and plugging it back in, and then wait another three minutes for the steam to resume. It has undoubtedly been put to use and has been helpful on numerous occasions. Getting wrinkle-free clothing has become necessary for travel and daily life. The functionality of this product is excellent, given its size and cost.\n \nThe product heats up quickly and is a perfectly manageable size. Use filtered or purified water to avoid limescale buildup that could damage equipment and stain garments. Although it removes wrinkles rapidly, it cannot replace ironing. The product is excellent overall, and I suggest it unless you plan to use it frequently for formal attire because doing so requires a lot of time. But don't let it deter you from purchasing it. I'm sure you will love it as much as I do and will use it extensively. People like me who take their time with their laundry to ensure minimal wrinkles would benefit from investing in this steamer. Despite our best efforts, there will inevitably be a few wrinkles here and there.",

        "content": "I had my last steamer- the kind that is on wheels with a pole to hang clothes from- for 11 years. It was time to get something new and I wanted one that didn’t take up as much space and I could take with me on vacations. This one had over 90k reviews- mostly positive- so I figured I’d grab it while it was on sale.\nIt arrived same day, it was simple to “put together” and use immediately. It is very lightweight and I’d say takes up as much space as a classic blow dryer if I were to pack it in a suitcase/overnight bag.\nIt took a bit to heat up, my larger one had a much bigger water tank and I feel like it took about 30s to heat up. This little guy has like a cup of water in its tank and it probably took closer to a minute to boil the water. Not a big deal just something I noticed.\nThe steam comes out with some force so I was impressed with that-my other steamer just seemed to allow the steam to just float out of the hose attachment.\nI used this steamer on 2 satin feeling camisoles that where just purchased and taken out of the packaging so they were in pretty bad shape with wrinkles and fold marks. This steamer did a pretty good job at removing all of the wrinkles in 1-3 passes. The biggest negative for me was that it sputters water a bit. I had this issues with my older steamer so it’s not a huge deal breaker, and so far I have had 0 issues with water stains but I can imagine on very delicate materials it could be bad. I also didn’t experience these droplets spilling onto my skin but the water is at boiling point so I would be careful.\nOverall for the sale price of 22$, I’m willing to keep this little guy and use it as my travel steamer. I still have my trustee old steamer just in case this one doesn’t last.",

        "content": "This thing gets really hot so be careful not to get your hands/skin near the blue nozzle. The steam was very effective in removing wrinkles for me. I put it close to the cotton fabric I was using. I also tried the little brush it came with too seemed to do just as good with it or without it. Before I started, I hung up my wrinkled items on hangers and on a little hook on my bathroom door. I then used the little plastic measuring cup it came with and poured water in up to the MAX line. After that, I screwed the top on which has little notches that lock in place when you turn the lid. Finally, I plugged it in and waited about 2 minutes for it to start steaming. Its light and easy to use and I like how it doesn't leave sharp lines and creases like an iron can. This is why I wanted to try a steamer. However, I was only able to steam 2 size large women's scrub tops, and my 7 year old daughters flannel shirt on a full handle of water with this steamer. I usually have 10-15 pieaces to iron at a time and therefore this would be a pain in the butt to keep stopping, turning the machine off, wait for it too cool down, add more water, then plug in and wait another 2-3 minutes for the steam to start up again only to do another 3 shirts. Its just not efficient time wise for me since I can iron so much faster. I will just continue to use a spray bottle of water when I don't want sharp lines from the iron. Therefore I will be returning this steamer and buying a new iron. This would be really awesome for someone that travels alot though because its small and handheld, and ideal for doing a few garments of clothing at a time.",

I tested it on my wrinkliest most finicky shirt, and it did a decent job, and way easier than trying to use an iron. On the advice of other reviews, I've only used filtered water in the reservoir (I have a hard water system), and so far no problems.\n\nWhat keeps it from being a 5 star is that sometimes it sputters and throws water droplets from the nozzle when it's less than half full, so keep that in mind if you're bringing it very close to the fabric.",

I've found that ironing a 10 foot by 8 foot white backdrop takes quite a long time with an iron. With the steamer I only need to smooth out the wrinkles in the area that will be in the photo frame. It's much easier and much quicker than using an iron.\n\nNot much to say about a steamer. It looks nice. Is sized not to be too heavy. It holds a decent amount of water.\n\nPut water in it. Plug it in. Switch it on. Some short time later steam comes out. It did all of these steps well.\n\nI recommend this steamer",

        "content": "Let me start with a disclaimer: I am writing this review after only using the product once, but i will update if my experience changes after continued use.\n\nI bought this steamer as a gift for my wife who wanted something simple to use and portable. The materials used seem decent enough for the price, it's small (definitely portable), and there's really nothing to using it other than filling it up and turning it on, which is exactly what she was looking for.\n\nI tested it out on one of my work shirts (before/after in pictures) that was particularly wrinkly (left in washer too long before being hung on rack to dry).\n\nI filled the unit up to just below the max line and turned it on. After about 1-2 minutes the unit was boiling and steam was steadily flowing out of the nozzle (this is essentially the same thing as an electric kettle but forces the steam from the boiling water out 5 small holes in the nozzle). I SLOWLY worked from bottom to top of the shirt on the front, back, and sleeves. After applying steam to all sides for about 4-5 mins total, I had the wrinkles down to a level that would be deemed acceptable for work in the office. Keep in mind that this unit is quite small (which is what makes it so portable), but the tradeoff for this is it doesnt produce nearly as much steam as a floor unit and hence takes more passes to achieve the \"wrinkle-free(ish)\" look.\n\nIf you're a big wig at a fortune 500 company, the results from this product certainly wont compare to a press from a dry cleaner (or even a decent ironing job from someone that knows what they're doing), but the results would be perfectly acceptable for normal office work or casual events.\n\nIf you're looking for something to replace your iron that gets the job done just as well in half the time, then I'd recommend going with a larger floor unit steamer. However, if you're like my wife and are simply looking for something simple, affordable, and portable that gets the job done, I believe you'll be satisfied with this product for the price like we are.\n\nPROS:\nPrice (very affordable at the time I purchased from amazon).\nEasy to use (just fill it up and turn it on).\nPortable (can easily fit in a carryon if desired).\nDoes a good enough job for what I paid for it.\n\nCONS:\nMUST use while completely upright (will spill boiling water if tilted too far - potential safety concern).\nThe unit is quite small so it takes longer than you might think it would to achieve desired results.\nGets small amount of condensation/sputters which may temporarily cause wet spots on clothes (they dry up quickly, but it's something to be aware of for some fabrics that may have color-stay issues).",

Just something to keep in mind when reading calculations based on the 22 lb hooks I bought & reviewed below.)\n***************************************************************************\nAmong other things, I'm using these on three steel doors to hold the curtain rods that hold the curtains. They are quite strong for their size (base is 1/2\" in diameter), and I'm very happy with their (parallel) holding power. I docked one star for two hooks that don't fit in their base, demoting them to refrigerator magnets.\n\nSimply put, a magnet's PULL STRENGTH measures (in kilograms or pounds) the amount of VERTICAL force required to PULL the magnet AWAY from the metal surface it is stuck to. Applying that to these magnetic hooks means that each one, when stuck to a metal CEILING, is rated for a maximum holding power of approximately 22 lbs/10 kg before it will PULL AWAY from the CEILING. (Assuming all CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL.)\n\nTake the same magnetic hook and put it on a WALL made of exactly the same material as the ceiling, and it will SLIDE DOWN the wall much easier than it will PULL AWAY from the ceiling (or PULL AWAY from the wall, for that matter). This is the magnet's PARALLEL HOLD or SHEAR FORCE, and it's not nearly as powerful as its PULL STRENGTH. This same concept explains why 2 magnets stuck together are easier to separate if you SLIDE them apart than if you try to PULL them apart.\n\nManufacturers are generally referring to PULL STRENGTH when stating the holding power of a magnet. Pull Strength is determined by the MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF WEIGHT A MAGNET HELD WHEN TESTED UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS. PARALLEL HOLD/SHEAR FORCE can be reasonably estimated at 10% to 25% of a magnet's PULL STRENGTH. With that in mind, we'll assume a PARALLEL HOLD of 17% for these magnetic hooks rated at 22 lbs (22lbs X 17% = 3.74 lbs). Under that assumption, we can expect that each hook (if used on a metal WALL or DOOR) should hold approximately 3 3/4 lbs of weight before it SLIDES DOWN THE WALL. Obviously, that's much less than its stated pull strength of 22 lbs (the amount of weight it should hold if used on a ceiling). Because a magnet fails under less weight when used on a wall rather than a ceiling, or holds less weight than stated on packaging or sale ads, does NOT mean that the magnet is flawed or the manufactuer and sellers are deceitful. The magnet is simply demonstrating, in real life, (and perhaps to the user's dismay), the difference between its PULL STRENGTH (22 lbs in this case) vs its PARALLEL HOLD/Shear Force (approximately 2 1/4 to 5 1/2 lbs = 10% to 25% of 22 lbs).\n\nIn addition to orientation, there are other factors or conditions that influence a magnet's performance/strength/holding power, SUCH AS:\nTHE MAGNET:\n**What is the magnet made of, what type of material? (ceramic, alloy, rare earth, etc),\n**What is the magnet's CONDITION? (chipped, cracked, scratched, dirty, etc)\n**What is its size and shape?\n**Is the magnet \"CUPPED\" or not? Cupped=magnet is placed into a steel 'cup' or 'holder', like the\nmagnets on these hooks. Cupping 'focuses' most of the magnet's pull in one direction [the open\nend of the cup], giving it more holding strength than it would have without the cup.\n**How has the magnet been HANDLED? Has it been stored correctly (it matters)? Has it been dropped? (dropping magnet=not good)\n\nENVIRONMENTAL:\n**What is the AMBIENT temperature and humidity level? Is there excess moisture present?\n**Will the magnet be completely submerged, used to attract submerged items?\n**What is the temperature of the metal the magnet will attach to? - What is the temperature of the magnet?\n\nTHE METAL:\n**What of the metal the magnet attracts or attaches to? - How thick is the metal? (thicker = better) - What are its components?\n**What is the condition of the metal item or surface? Is it BARE and CLEAN or is it coated, painted, dirty, greasy, rusty? - Is it perfectly FLAT or is it curved or uneven? Is it perfectly SMOOTH or is it textured, rough, bumpy, dented, chipped?\nANYTHING THAT INTERFERES WITH 100% FULL & DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN MAGNET AND METAL DIMINISHES THE MAGNET'S HOLDING POWER.\n~~~and that's just the short list, there's more, and it ALL matters.\n\nI think the physics of magnets and magnetism is fascinating, but technical and complex enough to blow MY mind right out of the science book! Fortunately, for most of us 'average consumers', this very BASIC understanding of PULL STRENGTH as it relates to PARALLEL HOLD is likely the most beneficial (and easiest to remember) when choosing a household, craft, hobby or shop magnet for your particular task.\n*********************************************************************************\nNOTE: IDEAL CONDITIONS for testing a magnet's holding power means the METAL is thick, perfectly smooth and flat, perfectly clean and bare. Same for the MAGNET, it is in PERFECT, new condition. Ambient conditions [temp, humidity, dust-free, etc] are also PERFECT. Everything is as perfect as it can be in order to achieve the maximum holding power of the magnet, and that result is what is stated on packaging, in ads, etc. Our personal-use conditions are not likely to be as perfect as testing conditions.",

        "content": "How well these hooks work depend on whether you hang the load parallel or perpendicual to whatever surface the magnet is attached.\n\nIf you attach to a vertical surface (like a wall), and hang something on the hook, it will likely slide right down the wall.\n\nHowever if you attach the magnet to a horizontal surface, like a ceiling, and the load is perpendicular , they work great, and easily hold 10lb.\n\nPersonally, I'm using them on cruises to hang things from the ceiling (since cruise ships have metal ceilings).\n\nIf you plan on attaching to refrigerator, stove, range hood, dishwasher door, etc.. they will slide down very easily, even with light loads (dish towel). You can reduce the sliding if you put something on the magnet side that increases the friction (masking tape) between the magnet and attachment surface.\n\nFor my specific use case, 4 stars. Reason i took off a star is because they magnet side has no protective film, so you can easily cause scratches. My solution was to put a piece of tape across the back. As long as the tape is thing enought, it doesn't affect the magnet adhesion much.",

The flexibility of the glass screen protector is the same as the plastic material, is it tempered glass or plastic?\n\nThis screen protector is a real tempered glass. The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass.\n\n2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it?\n\nThere is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around?\n\n3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone?\n\nYes, the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 4*Wet Wipe&4*Dry Wipe,2*Dust Absorber.\n\n4. How can I remove bubbles?\n\nUse the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector.\n\n5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector?\n\nLift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

You would think that due to cost, this set would not be affective…WRONG!!! I upgraded the phone in November and purchased this same brand for the new phone. Application is fairly easy…as easy as lining up and dealing with a sticky side but not bad. While walking after a long meeting last week on a cement pier with uneven areas I wasn’t paying enough attention to, I took a spill…and one harder than I realized due to the speed I was going. Huge bruised knee, nothing broken (I have really hard bones…a gift to a clumsy person) so I was fine. But when I looked at my phone that evening…holy smokes. A spider web crack in the corner and another at the bottom making it obvious where it hit. What I am most thankful for was the added camera lense cover!!! I almost didn’t add it thinking it already looked sturdy. Nope…it had a significant web crack that I’m sure meant had it not been there, the fall would have destroyed the lense. I am incredibly thankful for this simple but incredibly effective cover set and can’t recommend it more!",

    "description": "From the manufacturer\n\n\n\nNow with new colors available\n\nAbout Expo\n\nExpo isn't limited to how, when and what you write; it's about creating a smarter way to communicate. That's why great design and intuitive functionality are among the most important benefits of Expo writing systems. The goal is to continue making products with contemporary designs, colors and features that integrate all of your important information into one flexible space. So when life gets messy, you always have a clean slate to figure it out.\n\nExpo Low Odor Dry Erase Markers\nLife. ReMarkable. And now with less odor.\n\nThe #1 branded dry erase marker is now available in a special Low Odor version with less odor than both conventional dry erase markers and Expo's own markers. With more new colors to choose from, you'll be able to brighten any presentation and let your creativity fly.\n\nUse Expo's dry erase markers to track, schedule, and present your point in a brilliant fashion. Intense, bold colors take center stage even from a distance. You can get Expo wet or dry erase markers in a wide range of tip sizes, ensuring your point gets across. And now, Expo Markers feature the same bright, vivid color now with low-odor, better-erasing ink--one swipe and it's gone.\n\nSpecially formulated low odor ink ideal for classrooms, small offices, and homes\nNew, better-erasing ink--one swipe and it’s gone\nBroad, bold markings mean no reading glasses required\nCertified AP Nontoxic ink\nAvailable in fine point, bullet point, and chisel tip\n20 colors to choose from\nExpo: Markers for Any Occasion\n\nWith an extensive range of colors and tip sizes, you can always have the tool you need close at hand with Expo's line of Wet and Dry Erase Markers.\n\nIdeas to Simplify Your Life and Embrace Your Space with Expo\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\nChore Board\n\nUsing a whiteboard and Expo markers to make a family chore board is the simple solution to getting everyone (spouses included!) to pitch in without pitching a fit. You can let go of round-the-clock reminders, as \"I forgot\" is no longer a valid excuse.\n\n\t\nHead of the Class\n\nGive kids a whiteboard and Expo Washable markers to allow them to keep learning long after the school day is over. Take a fifteen-minute recess out of your day to be a student in their pretend classroom as they \"teach\" you their latest lesson. They'll get some fun study time and you'll always get a gold star for attendance.\n\n\t\nThe List Goes On\n\nMultiple mouths to feed mean you're constantly catering to the likes and dislikes of others. Keep up with their varying tastes by putting an Expo board on the fridge so everyone can request their favorite fare. They'll remain satisfied and you'll be happy to never hear \"There's nothing for me to eat\" ever again.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\nRoot for the Home Team\n\nGrab some Expo markers in the team colors and go wild on the car windows. It's a fun family activity to show your support and comes off when the game is over. Which is especially nice if someone wasn't quite as victorious as they'd hoped.\n\n\t\nLife Labeled\n\nUse Expo markers to label your plastic containers. If they're clear, taping a small piece of paper on the opposite side will keep your label legible. And you can change your mind with a flick of the wrist.\n\n\t\nEntertaining Possibilities\n\nUse Expo markers on glass trays to write out the names of specialty hors'devours or wine and cheese pairings. You can also write on small decorative tiles for reusable place settings or buffet labels. Your guests will be thrilled when the only thing they have to ask is \"More wine please?\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tExpo Original Dry Erase\tExpo Clickable Dry Erase\tExpo Washable Dry Erase\tExpo Low Odor Dry Erase\tExpo Neon Window\tExpo Scented Dry Erase\nAP-Certified Non-Toxic Ink\t✓\t✓\t✓\t✓\t✓\t✓\nLow Odor Ink Formula\t✓\t✓\t✓\t\t\t✓\nNumber of Colors Available\t9\t6\t6\t12\t5\t4\nDesigned for Glass\t\t\t\t\t✓\t\nRetractable\t\t✓\t\t\t\t\nWashable Ink\t\t\t✓\t\t\t",

Has the UV light and a test card to see the glasses really block utv light. I checked my prescription glasses against these and they both have same results!\n\nMy daughter is 11 and looks so cute in the clear. She picked clear out, because I wear clear framed glasses! Hah! She really likes them and she wears them for mostly the entire day. Very happy it wasn’t hard to get her ti wear them since she is home schooled and in a computer 75% of the day.\n\nWish the delivery was just as good as the product....\nWhen I went outside to get them the driver was smokin weed. As I got my package and pulled it into the house it SMELLED like crazy of marijuana. Its been in a back now for about a week and it smells so bad of marijuana. Apparently Amazon now employes 420 friendly people who do it while on the clock. When reported to a manager about what my experience was, she shrugged it off. My daughter is highly allergic to this and her throat started swelling shut.\n\nVery disappointed.",

My eye’s definitely hurt less at the end of the day. 2) They are light weight 3) The case is great for traveling. 4) Very reasonably priced.\n\n2 Cons: 1) the frames were too small for my face, specifically the temples (the side part of the frame) which were not long enough to go over my entire ear. I’m not sure how to measure the size of my face but I’m a 6’2” slender male. 2) the nose bridge consistently leaves red marks on my nose which does fade over time.\n\nOverall, I’d buy them again because they are reasonably priced and reduce my eye strain, but I wouldn’t buy them for me. The next pair I buy I’ll look for a larger temple length so they fit my face better.",

        "content": "For some reason, lately, either I've been on my various devices TOO much or I'm developing some sort of sensitivity, I started getting headaches and eye stress whenever I looked at a screen of any kind. I'm on my computer (work/personal) as well as my phone and tablet, so avoiding any of those is just not feasible.\n\nWhile I am trying to decrease mindless screen-time and other ways to cope (low light levels, not holding my phone right up to my face, etc) my eye doctor suggested blue light tinted glasses when I wear my contacts and possibly get that feature on a pair of new glasses.\n\nI bought these on a whim after an hour's worth of researching and all these glasses seemed really similar in look and reviews. I did want something stylish as I'd wear them often but also funcitonal. I knew I didn't want the yellow-tinted glasses and literally just bought these with my fingers crossed and expected them to not work.\n\nNot only did you get 2 pairs (a lot of choices to choose from too! I got the clear and dark tortoise pattern), you get protective sleeves (granted, will only prevent the lines from getting scratched and that's about it), a small eye glass screw you can attach to your keyring (!), AND a blue light to test out your glasses (which I did, and my glasses passed--yay!).\n\nSOOOOOO, the REAL test is wearing them and seeing if they help (i.e., reduce my headaches and eye strain). And the verdict...?\n\nTHESE WORK.\n\nI'm so shocked tbh cuz these were rather cheap. But honestly, these glasses LOOK good and are made of thick, durable plastic. I get compliments on both pairs since I got them a couple weeks ago. There is a slight difference when you put them on (a very subtle yellow-ish/gold tint) but it's not at all distracting or so different when wearing them or not. The first week, I didn't notice too much of a difference (to be fair, I kept forgetting to wear them). By the second week--these glasses have become a game-changer. I'm used to wearing them on the regular and can use my devices and watch TV and be on my computer for longer and less headaches. When I'm not wearing them, like at night and wearing my regular glasses, I get a headache after a half hour so these glasses help alleviate it a lot.\n\nDo I still get headahes? Yes, esp if I am staring at a screen a lot but the headaches aren't as strong and not as distracting. Basically, if I'm wearing these glasses and start noticing that pressure in my forehead and behind my eyes, I know I've been on the screen too much and take a long break.\n\nOne issue i have--and possibly contributing to my headache--is that these glasses are a bit heavy on my nose bridge. Now, to be transparent, I do have a narrow, small bridge and it sits slightly lower than where the arms of the glasses fit over my ears so sometimes, certain glass style cause added pressure where it sits on my nosebridge. To be clear, I don't have this issue with all glasses so something about this design is adding to that heavy feeling on my nosebridge and I at times, I have to take them off to give my nose bridge a rest, which is kind of a bummer but hopefully I'll get used to it.\n\nMy chief complaint is how tight the arms press against the side of my head. I might have a larger head for these glasses so I used the mini-screw driver and loosened the screws enough to lessen that pressure and hopefully, that'll take care of it feeling so tight against my head.\n\nAll in all--quite pleased with this product. Just relieved it worked for me!",

So I ordered a pair of these glasses in hopes they would block the blue light so I could fall asleep faster.\n\nThe pair of glasses come with 2 eyeglass sleeves, for storing the glasses, a cleaning cloth, a tiny double-headed screwdriver, that can be put on your keychain, a little flashlight that can also be put on your keychain, and a nice box for storing your glasses or organizing your bedside drawer, and a test card so you can see if the glasses block blue light.\n\nThey do seem to block blue light--at least their test card says they do. I could see they were doing something, when I put them on, but I'm not exactly sure what they were doing. Whatever it was, it made my eyes hurt after about an hour so I think I will have to gradually increase the time I wear them.\n\nThey also hurt the bridge of my nose and my ears but then again I'm not used to wearing glasses for more then a few minutes. I suspect I will need to buy some silicone nose and ear pads for the glasses since I'll need to wear them for a couple of hours each night.\n\nThis is my initial impression of the glasses and my opinion might change over time. However, the pair of glasses seem to be a good buy as they are well made and come with some handy accessories.",

I absolutely am obsessed that they provided a test strip and a anti- blue ray light. This is great! I may order again if I lose these, I gave 4 stars because I just got them so idk how they work.

I have noticed a significant difference in my eyes feeling less tired and strained when using my computer, phone and tablet.\n\nThe glasses also have UV400 protection which is an added bonus that helps protect my eyes from harmful rays.\n\nThe pack of two is also a great value, as it gives me a spare pair to use or share with someone else.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Livho 2 pack Blue Light Blocking Glasses to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of screens and wants to reduce the negative effects on their eyes and overall well-being.",

        "content": "11 years ago my youngest daughter had to work hard at getting me, a tight fisted Scotswoman, to buy a Diaper Genie. I am her primary babysitter. Her oldest is 11 years old so I have owned the first Diaper Genie since he was a baby. Even after he outgrew the need for a Diaper Genie I set it aside. Well, now I am the primary Babysitter for our youngest Grandchild. I now have an upstairs and a downstairs Diaper Genie. There is NO telltale smell that there are used diapers in the house. The REFILLS are easy to use. They hold about 12 used diapers before needing to change them out. Buying the three pack is wise, then you don’t have run and buy more refills in a hurry. You can get the refills in most stores easily. They aren’t expensive. And since being introduced to to the whole concept of Diaper Genies I have come up with another use for them. We have a camper. Trash sometimes can be a problem. I decided to use one of my Diaper Genie’s as a trash can in the camper. The bags are treated with something to keep the smells away so why not use it for a trash can in the camper?\nThe Diaper Genie and the refills are a great idea. I wish I had invented it.",

And when I tell you that I have absolutely no idea how my household has not suffocated from the amount of dander and dust that filled the tank after my psychotic cleaning sesh….I was disturbing. I clean my floors regularly…at least once a week…plus the solid “once over” that I do in the high traffic areas daily (kitchen, litter box area, entry way, etc.) I’m still in shock…..I’m pretty sure she captured hair samples that have lived dormant in the depths of the carpet on the stairs from all the previous occupants.\n\nI’m not gonna lie…..price-point wise…. I feel like I owe someone some money….. because she’s worth so much more than what I paid!!!!\n\nI don’t normally write reviews….. but I felt like hyping this lady on Amazon was the very least I could do💁🏻‍♀️ Buy the vacuum!",

I ordered because I could still see pet hair in my carpet after vacuuming. We just bought the house and adopted the previous owners Great Dane because this is his home ☺️, we intruded. He’s the best pruppet ever but his shedding drives me crazy since we’ve never had an inside dog before. I used to vacuum our old house once every few weeks but feel it very necessary to vacuum daily with a pet inside. My husband and I both have bad allergies so this is a must. So happy with my purchase so far. Will go back over same approximate 22-12 area again in a little bit to see what else I can pick up. It’s fairly heavy for stairs in my opinion but I’ll deal if it does this good of a job. Putting my tineco downstairs because it’s rarely used.",

        "content": "My old Samsung died, so we ordered this one after searching for what the best budget vacuum for pet hair is. I am so glad we chose this one so far.\nOut of the box, you put the handle on and put the 2 screws in to hold it together while everything else just snaps into place. Easy peasy.\nAfter we vacuumed our 8x10 area rug and hardwood floors and the front door rug, this is what came up. I was a little grossed out, but we have 2 cats and a German shepherd/great Pyrenees/chow mix who definitely sheds. So we needed something to really get all that hair and dander up so the kids can play safely. This was it.\nIt's super easy to empty out, just 2 buttons. One on the top to release it from the vacuum, and one on the back to drop the bottom over the garbage to empty it. I love that the hose is just a regular hose with attachments, you don't have to lift the whole handle off like some others. The attachments made it so easy to clean the carpeted stairs, also.\nOverall, this has exceeded my expectations in the first few days of owning it. Hopefully it holds up well!!",

        "content": "I bought this based on reviews and it definitely performs well for our:\n2 dogs + 1 cat\nHardwood, tile, wool and synthetic rugs of varying thicknesses\n\nMy main gripe is the inability to disengage the beater bar; most rug manufacturers suggest turning off the beater bar to avoid potential snagging or premature wear. Not every rug will be destroyed by the spinning bristles, but they can gradually fray and suction too much rug fiber (especially on wool rugs) and pull strands from other weaves. I somewhat resolve this by using only the highest setting, but the canister fills before I've finished half of an 8 x 10 rug. Wool already sheds a lot and I hate seeing a canister full of blue wool fibers. I now empty it when it's a ¼ full (every time) otherwise I'd need a ruler to drag out the hair, fibers, and other general ick from accumulating deep in the canister.\n\nBut this same powerful suction is excellent for getting everything else on the floor. The unit is lightweight and easy to maneuver. The swivel head works well and the head's side bristles snag debris up along the floor trim. I do not use the wand attachments because the hose doesn't stretch easily and I don't feel like fighting with it. I don't mind because I have a separate, smaller unit for upholstery.\n\nAt a good price, this vacuum is a valuable tool in my arsenal against pet hair. I'm glad I bought it. It would certainly be better with a few tweaks. If I was only vacuuming hard surfaces, this would probably be my only vacuum.\n\nHope this helps!",

Picked up a lot of pet hair real good for me. Of course, long term performance will in large part depend on how well you maintain it. I got this for my Dad and I doubt he would know what to do but with me, I clean them after each use and will clean the filters regularly and inspect the hose for clogs regularly, so that would surely affect performance.\n\nI did not like the way the dust canister simply rests against the intake opening, it didn't really snap into it, or fit into it. Didn't seem to affect performance or leak dust, I just didn't like it and suspect it could be problematic if the canister ever doesn't fit snugly in the future.\n\nSome have complained about hose length, the best way to use the hose is to detach the handle as that is the extension for length, but you have to be aware of where the vacuum is sitting, I don't think the brush roll stops when upright, or can be stopped when running.\n\nAn issue I've had with every vacuum I've handled thus far, the cord wrap never seems to be fully accommodating for the length of cord you have to wrap around it. It's not very long but neither are the ends you wrap the cord over, deep enough so you have lots of cord wrapping around pegs that aren't deep enough to make the cord fit without wanting to overhang or slip off.\n\nCons aside, for the price point I am happy with this. I wanted lightweight, strong suction and long cord. Easy to empty and maintain.",

        "content": "My husband and I bought a new bedroom suit, upgrading our mattress size to king. We opted for a cheap mattress since we were buying the suit, with plans to replace the mattress at a later date.\n\nThe mattress we purchased was memory foam. Memory foam can make you sweat, and our mattress does just that. So much so that we will likely wind up having to replace it sooner than later, not saving anything in the long run.\n\nI purchased this cover for two reasons. First, to try to cut down on the sweating. Second, I can’t wash the mattress, so I always add a mattress pad or protector that can be washed if needed.\n\nMy review of this pad is that it’s sort of like a thick, fluffy comforter. It’s kind of squishy. I am not sure what I was expecting but I was going for the feel of a pillow top. It doesn’t feel like that but it doesn’t feel like you just tucked a comforter under your sheet either. All I can say is that it made the mattress a lot softer. Whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of opinion.\n\nMy husband doesn’t sleep well on it but didn’t sleep well on the mattress. He still sweats but not as much (didn’t on our old pillow top - it’s the mattress). I wouldn’t say that this would resolve that issue/cool you down that much. He also says it is too soft in comparison to our daughter’s (doesn’t have the pad on her bed). I tend to think that his issues can’t be resolved without replacing the mattress and am not going to blame them on the pad. The fact is, I doubt there is a pad on the market that would make him like our current mattress any more than he does.\n\nAs for me? I like it. Our old pillow top had gotten too soft for me (your core changes quite a bit when you have twins!) and I was having trouble getting in and out of bed at night to check on the kids. My hips were hurting constantly and my back spasms made it more efficient for me to just sleep on the couch. The new mattress was a bit uncomfortable for me, and this pad improved my quality of sleep tremendously. It is soft enough that my hips don’t kill me when I lay on my side at night, my back spasms have mostly stopped so that I’m better able to get in and out of bed with the kids, and I just feel comfortable when I’m laying in it.\n\nI am not someone that has ever owned an expensive mattress and this is an improvement over the egg crates we used to use when I was a kid. My mom and sister liked it enough to get one for their beds and have liked using them so far (they have the same mattress and found it uncomfortable as well.... I have not laundered mine but my sister washes hers weekly and has not complained).\n\nAt the end of the day, this mattress cover is not going to make your mattress feel like a pillow top or high end mattress if it isn’t. It also isn’t going to make your mattress feel like you crammed a comforter under your sheets. It doesn’t slide around or bunch up. It is not going to solve any problems with night sweats, and it is probably going to be too soft if you like a firm mattress.\n\nWhat it is likely to do is add some cushion to an otherwise too firm mattress. If your mattress is so unsupportive that your hips hurt when you lay on your side at night, it might help. If you’re tossing and turning and not sleeping well because of that sort of thing, it may help. If you just want to add a little cushion, it might help. If you just want a mattress cover you can launder, it would work (I don’t believe it is waterproof but we didn’t need that).\n\nAs for us, it is an okay purchase. Didn’t solve my husband’s problems but solved mine and I’m grateful for that. I’m sure that we will soon be replacing the mattress with a better quality, non memory foam one, and when we do, we won’t be using this any longer. For now, I think it was worth the money.\n\nI don’t have any complaints so I’m giving it 5 stars. That doesn’t mean it upgraded our mattress - it just means that it does what I believe it was advertised to do and I got what I expected from it.",

        "content": "I did a lot of research before I purchased this mattress pad/topper. The reviews on it were superb and I am here to tell you that those reviews are absolutely true! I really didn’t think it would live up to the expectations I had, boy was I wrong! I let the topper sit for a day after I unpacked it, it is super compacted in the shipping box. Then I washed it in my top loader average size washer, used warm water on a delicate cycle. Then I ran it through the dryer, average size. You have to check on it every 10 minutes or so to make sure it drying evenly. Otherwise it can sit too long in one spot where the heat is coming in. I didn’t want it to get damaged. I used the low heat, cotton setting. Then I put it on the bed, I have a queen size mattress and it fit perfectly!! The sides and elastic are well made, fit nicely and stay it place. Man was I happy when I got into bed that night, and every night since! It is super plush, like sleeping on a feather mattress. It’s not too soft, it’s a perfect combination of soft and plush. It doesn’t leave indentations, meaning when you get out of it, it fluffs back up. Even when I roll over at night and reposition, I don’t feel an indentation. Every time I wash my sheets, once a week, I rotate the mattress topper 160 degrees. I will wash it every couple months. It’s so comfortable! I look forward to getting into bed every night! I am so happy with this product! I was thinking I might have to buy two and stack them, if this one wasn’t soft enough. So happy to find that there was no need for that. Highly, highly recommend this mattress topper. I’m surprised it’s so inexpensive, I would’ve paid double for it. The quality of the material and the sewing is top notch! I only have a good things to say about this product.",

        "content": "So we had purchased a Queen memory foam mattress from Bobs Furniture in 2020. I disliked it from the beginning, but he was partial to it for the 1st couple months, then he eventually agreed with me he didn't like it. I had this issue where he would sink into the mattress and I wouldn't - which created this \"sink hole\" around him, and if I slept too close to him I would roll right in there and it was really uncomfortable for me. Well I randomly came across this the other night and impulsively ordered it. I wasn't sure how it was going to work out because he likes a firmer bed and I like soft. He thought our mattress was already too soft. BUT we threw it on (totally forgot to stick it in the dryer to fluff it up) and its wonderful. The sink hole has been eliminated and I can now sleep closer to him. It has made our bed so much more comfortable. Even the cats like it! Ever since we put it on, they try to sleep directly on it by our heads lol. Warning: this mattress pad will make your bed so comfy that it's a LOT harder to get out of bed in the morning LOL. Almost forgot to mention how much this thing has helped us with overheating at night. We would wake up super sweaty (thanks memory foam)- haven't had that issue since we put this on. I caught a cold and last night I definitely would have had to change at least 3 times throughout the night if it wasn't for this mattress pad.",

These things are BRIGHT!\n\nIn all seriousness, though, these lights are pretty impressive. They're easy to install and come with everything you need to set them up, including a remote control that lets you switch between colors and modes.\n\nI particularly appreciate that these lights are so long - 100 feet is more than enough to wrap around my entire living room twice. I can now create a disco ball-esque ambiance in my home that would make John Travolta himself jealous.\n\nMy only minor complaint about these lights is that the adhesive backing isn't the strongest, so you may need to use some additional tape or glue to keep them in place. But let's be real - when you're creating a light show this epic, a little extra tape is a small price to pay.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the Keepsmile 100ft Led Strip Lights to anyone looking to add a little pizzazz to their home. Just be prepared to don some sunglasses when you turn them on!",

I just happened to have a cable extension that worked with its power supply, it’s only like 2 feet long from the packaging so you’ll need one unless you don’t mind messy cables. Also, the remote it came with only worked for about 5 minutes then broke (new batteries didn’t fix it) but luckily the app that controls it is better than the remote. When you use the app, use some gibberish email, it doesn’t require you to authenticate it saving you from sharing your actual email. I got it on sale for less than 20$ which is quite the deal for a whole room, but just only. If you can get the strip for <20$ plus a cable extension its a deal, if not look somewhere else.",

We installed the 1st set with temporary double-sided tape until we were confident of our layout and coverage (using your own tape is a pain). This took maybe an hour to cover the whole room. We were amazed and pleasantly surprised that the strips were long enough to do everything we wanted. We didn't cut or use any connectors. At corners, we simply folded the strip onto itself. Worked great. In our second room, we loved the way the 1st room came out so much that we used the adhesive on the strip itself. Wow! This worked so much better, and faster! 20 minutes and the room was done. Other than brushing off the dust on window frames, we didn't clean the wall or anything and the adhesive stuck great! The folded corners stuck tightly around the windows. In both strips, all LEDs worked perfectly and look great. Amazing spectrum of color and brightness that you can tune via the app and remote. Custom buttons on the remotes that you can program your favorite colors. The app worked perfectly 1st try and lets you set timers for the lights, etc. We're 100% satisfied and recommend these!",

        "content": "First, the box cover image is very misleading. This light string will only produce 1 color at a time. This is not an addressable strip just RGB.\n\nSecond, it states two reels. This requires the power supply to be in the middle of the strips ( the box has a Y to connect the two strips) You can not chain the the strips together. I did test to see if they would light up okay when chained, and they do, but there is not a connector at the end of the strip to allow the next strip to be plugged in (this may be a power and/or saftey \"feature\"). You cannot put power at one end and expect to run a line 100 feet long as a result.\n\nOut of 1 and 1/4 strips I have up. I have 1 LED that twinkles slightly. Not overly noticeable, but once seen, you can't unsee.\n\nI used Hot Glue ( reasons) so I can't speak to the adhesion\n\nThe Mic feature is responsive, however the lights tend to strobe multiple colors rather than dim and brighten with a pre-picked color. ( I would love the team's colors to dim and brighten based off the crowd noise on the TV, instead I get a strobing effect of a bunch of random colors)\n\nAlso, the app has some \"scenes\" that have some predefines. Some are nice and some are obnoxious.there are some that will fade from one color to another but you cannot define the two colors.\n\nFInally, you cannot get a yellow to show up\nA good RGB value for yellow is 250, 250,60\nHowever the closet you can get when putting in those value in the app is a color that looks like a saturated 150, 255,200.\n\nI wasn't looking or expecting true color or a lot of features, but slightly disappointed by the lack of yellow, and unable to program a fade from one color to another.\n\nThe remote that comes with it does appear to work but only when it wants to, the mobile app is much better and works with bluetooth so no internet of things worries.",

Install was simple, the hardest part was initially pulling the plastic off of the back of the adhesive, once i was able to get a little tab separated, it came off without an issue. The 50’ length was way too long and I was able to cut it to a shorter length so I didn’t have a ton of extra light under the bed. I didn’t see clear instructions in how to cut it, but I used my experience with led strips and cut in the middle of the gold color dots (not the silver ones) and it worked perfectly fine once I plugged it in. The lights aren’t the brightest LED’s on the market and the LED’s are spaced out a little further than most lights I have used in the past, but for what I was trying to do it worked perfectly. Setting up with the app was pretty simple as long as you know how to use bluetooth and scan a QR code, but my biggest complaint is that some of the colors are not true color matches, for example the yellow is more of yellow green.\n\nBottom line is that it works well for the money, if you’re picky and want something super high quality, I recommend you go with something a little more expensive. If you’re like me and just wanted a decent product at low cost, you should be satisfied with this.",

The flexibility of the glass screen protector is the same as the plastic material, is it tempered glass or plastic?\n\nThis screen protector is a real tempered glass. The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass.\n\n2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it?\n\nThere is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around?\n\n3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone?\n\nYes, the package includes: 6*Guide Stickers, 3*Wet Wipe&3*Dry Wipe,3*Dust Absorber.\n\n4. How can I remove bubbles?\n\nUse the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector.\n\n5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector?\n\nLift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

So I was a little skeptical trying another product but decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did. I followed the instructions to the letter and it lay perfectly flat to the phone screen the very first time. It would be nice if it came with a guide to position the protector like some other products do because I was concerned about alignment but that turned out not to be a problem and I aligned it perfectly. I have only used one out of the pack but I'm extremely happy with it. I keep the phone in my pocket along with a pocket knife and keys and it has not picked up one scratch.

It also has a large rectangular cutout at the top, rather than the small cut out for the ear speaker that some other screen protectors have.

They probably label this same model for several similar sized phones.\n\nIt covers the part of the class that contains the image, but leaves a noticeable gap around the edges. I'm using a case as well, so there is not much chance of impact at the exposed areas of the glass. It'll still probably protect my screen, but next time I change it, I'll get one that more closely fits the full glass of my phone.\n\nIt's about 3mm too narrow and about 4mm too short to reach the edges of the my phone case. I anticipate the accumulation of dust, dirt, etc. in the gaps. A small issue, but an easily avoidable one. Like I said, I'll probably just pay a wee bit more for a fitted one next time I change it rather than using the extras that came with this one.\n\nMy last one was a DBrand and it did not stick well, but it did cover pretty much the whole glass.

        "content": "I decided to research water filters for my shower after my hair dresser commented on how my previously healthy hair had gotten dried out and tangled along with scalp flaking! So after researching what might be the cause of my hair issues, I decided to try the AquaBliss SF100 filter. It arrived the same day that I order it, nice! Even though the reviews stated it was easy to install I procrastinated until the next day, dreading the possible obstacles that MY shower might present! After reading the instructions I decided to take the plunge and try to install it. I was stunned at how easy it was and how the well the water flowed! I had had some previous issues while installing the hand held shower head, so I had reservations about adding an additional gadget. The house is 50 years old. I am now on day two of enjoying and benefiting from the new \"clean\" water! I use to get out of the shower feeling like a slick film was on my skin, thinking maybe it was the moisturizing bath lotions I use or perhaps the combination of the using after bath moisturizers that maybe some how didn't completely come off during the showering. After my first shower my skin felt wonderful! No more film! I purposely didn't apply an after shower moisturizer because I wanted to enjoy that clean skin feeling!! Day two, I was eager to hop in the shower to experience this new clean feeling once again and this time I did apply the after shower moisturizer and my skin is no longer itchy and feels great! Who looks forward to taking a shower? Lucky people with filtered water, that's who! Wow, what a transformation! I just wish I had found the filter earlier on or even knew that I needed it! Now, just on day two I haven't shampooed yet, but I was so excited about my skin feeling and looking much better (this is being written in the dead of winter, too, so that says a lot) I couldn't wait to do the review! I will update after the shampoo. I didn't test the water before I put the filter on, but the noticeable difference in how clean my skin feels is what matters! Fingers crossed, this will revive my hair, too!! Also, I can't report on the longevity of the filter yet, as it has only been two days. So far it has been well worth it! Glad I took the risk and tried it!",

It has made a world of difference! I've gone from hair that looks like I stick my finger in a socket every morning, so soft, healthy looking (and feeling) hair that is manageable and doesn't break at the ends! I have only had this for a short time and even after the first two days I felt and saw a noticeable difference.\n\nThe filter is super easy to install and made very little difference in terms of the placement of my shower head. I was a little worried it would make the shower head sit too low and the water stream would hit me in my mid back, but it really didn't change that much at all. It also didn't change the flow of the water at all, which is even more surprising! My boyfriend always complains about low water flow, so this was a particular concern, but he hasn't said anything other than that his skin feels so much better now!\n\nTruly, this thing is amazing, and I'll be buying a replacement on time from now until I live somewhere with better water. Honestly, my hair was falling out, breaking, looked dull and lifeless, and my skin was actually scaly! I've never even had to moisturize my skin, and it was scaly! That all cleared up in the first week with this amazing filter. I cannot recommend it more!",

Skin had always been dry after showers and had to put oil in my hair because water was so hard. After filter installation my hair was instantly soft after showers and didn't need to use oil anymore. Skin is also much less dry and doesn't itch as much.\n\nCon: didn't seem to last as long as I had hoped (but may just be the fact that water is so hard).",

It sounds silly, but it really does make a difference! Not only that, the hooks themselves are very sturdy, and I love that they don't fall off the rod, nor do my curtains fall off the hooks!\nThey're fairly easy to put up, I do notice that the opening is a little narrowing than a normal hook, however I feel this adds to the benefit since they won't pop off.\n\nI've also had to remove these due to a move, and they came off very easily with no damage!\n\nLastly, the first set I had held up for well over a year! The only reason I bought a second set is because we ended up having a second bathroom - the first set is still going strong with no damage or issues!\n\nHighly recommend these :)",

Keep receipts and purchase history. I was blown away at the results. It took a 2 hours to do but I really made sure I did everything correct. I hardly bust a sweat on this it’s that easy lol. The gloves kinda suck that’s the only thing I will say. Other then that this kit is great! I was looking to replace the headlights but that was upwards of $500 for the headlights no labor. So I gambled on this and it worked perfectly. Again u won’t regret this purchase just watch some review videos and follow instructions 100%. Also as a tip the ceramic dries fast so don’t remove tape till it’s dry u don’t want to touch it when it’s drying. It’s rare for me to be this happy with a purchase and I felt like I had to review this for everyone. Enjoy the pics.\n\nUPDATE: I woke up today before the sunrise and I can see there is a little bit haze on my headlight. It’s not a perfect kit after all. U can’t see the haze when lights are off. It is a lot brighter and it’s better then before so it’s still a WIN but be aware there will be a little weird haze on headlight afterwards.",

        "content": "Its a quality restoration kit. Estimate on box is 30 minutes, but for me it was 30 minutes per headlight so an hour in total. Don't know how long it will last but I did it to both my truck and my wife's CRV. Headlights feel and look almost new with this kit if you put the elbow grease into it. Need to do a decent amount of wet sanding with the pad provided in the kit. Take your time with the 2000 grit to get the big scratches out, and likewise with the 3000 grit to get that fine finish. Your headlights should be a consistent milky fog when your done. They also recommend a water spray bottle. I learned at the autobody shop to use a bucket of water and either a sponge or a washcloth instead of spray bottle. Put the sponge in one hand and the sand paper in the other. Place the sponge above your sanding area and slowly squeeze letting out a constant stream of water as you sand. When the sponge or washcloth is empty simply dunk it back in the water bucket and continue the process. If you cut corners on the sanding you will have blemishes on your headlights, so take your time. I will update later to see how long the cerakote lasts.",

        "content": "In short this product really works. My 15-year-old car had very cloudy headlights. I was prepared to replace the headlights. I got a quote from a repair shop for almost $1,000 for new headlights and the labor to replace the headlights.\n\nI searched and researched a lot to see which is the best headlight restoration kit. I landed on this one and figure it's less than 20 bucks might as well take a shot. As I was going through step one and step two I saw my headlights were becoming even more really cloudy and Scratched up. I thought I damaged my headlights and wasted 20 bucks. But no joke after step three it's just like a miracle happened and the perfect headlights came through crystal clear. I could not believe it. This is magic. This was some of the best $17 and change I've spent on a product. Thank you! I'm going to buy another pack for my other.\n\nAnd no power tools required!\n\nBe careful when you do step 3. you pretty much have to do it in one shot. Follow the instructions. Do overlapping swipes from top to bottom. If you try to keep going back and forth it will kind of get smudged and it won't look as clear. Also I recommend that you mask around the headlights with blue painters masking tape because as you scrub the headlights you can potentially damage your paint job.",

        "content": "This is definitely a \"Trust the process\" kind of situations. Your headlights start out cloudy, then you're effectively scratching it up even more and making them worse... until the last step.\n\nStep 1: Tape off all surrounding areas. This ensures you don't scratch your paint. Then use the four oxidation removal pads. One after another, giving it a good moderately firm scrub. Once the pad turns yellow, toss and go onto the next one. Once all four are done, clean the surface with water and microfiber cloth.\n\nNote - If this gets on your paint, just wipe it off right away.\n\nStep 2: Use red pad with spray bottle filled with water, apply moderately-light pressure in singular and consistent direction to start scuffing up the lens. It's important you use a lot of water and continue back and forth in the same direction. Do this for a few minutes until you feel like you no longer understand what's happening. Then rinse and go onto the grey applicator. Do the same process. This is refining those scratch marks.\n\nRinse completely and dry with microfiber again. Your headlight should be cloudy. This doesn't reel right, does it. It actually looks worse.\n\nStep 3: Completely dry lens, use ONE ceramic applicator pad and with a top to down motion, go from one side to another. Always overlapping 50%.\n\nStep back. Let it dry and be amazed.\n\nFinal thoughts: Honestly, trust the process. I can't speak for longevity as I just applied it yesterday. I almost want to put a clear coat on it, but this was cheap enough where if I have to do it again in a year, it's not a big deal. I'll then put a 2X clear coat on afterwards. But dang, did it ever do the job I was looking for. Also, I'd assume if your headlights were worse than mine, you'd probably spend more time on step 2. Overall, I spent one hour for both headlights.",

So, I decided to try this product first. I had used other products that promised good results but they performed poorly. I followed the instructions to refinish them with Cerakote Headlight Restoration Kit and both headlights now look great. Pretty simple process that most people could do it. I think they left one KEY step in the instructions. I was very careful when sanding the lens but I did scratch the paint in a couple of areas that butts up against the lens. This was on the first headlight. I taped off the second lens and I didn't have any scratches. I used Painters Tape so as not to leave any residue on the fender. Add this one step and you will be much happier when you don't have to try and buff out the scratches in the paint surrounding the lens! By the Way! I used a leaf blower on the lenses to dry they before applying the final coat. I didn't have an air compressor as suggested in the instructional demo.",

        "content": "This kit includes two small circles each of 2000 and 3000 grit sandpaper. My headlights had half a clear coat on them, probably left over from a previous repair. When I sanded them down with the provided sandpaper, there was a very clear difference between the two sections and I didn't want to apply the clear coat until it was uniform. Couldn't get it off with 2k. Luckily I had some fine sandpaper lying around, but I had to go all the way down to 200 (!!!) before I could remove the old clear coat. Then I had to work my way back up through 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, and then use the provided 2000 and 3000 grit. If I hadn't had sandpaper on hand I would have been screwed.\n\nIf your headlights are blotchy like mine were, it might be better to get a kit with a drill attachment. This was like four hours of hand sanding. Would have been ten minutes if not for the old clear coat, but oh well.\n\nOther than that, the resin wipes were magical. Super cool to see it instantly take effect as you slide the wipe across. Take your headlights off the car and apply the resin in a dust-free space! I have a little bit of marring, really not noticeable until you look at it but not absolutely perfect. However, for twenty bucks vs $1-2k for a new pair of headlights, I can't complain.\n\nI can't rate longevity yet. I'm expecting a couple years; if they start to fade within the year I'll adjust my review.",

The headlights on my car (after 180,000 miles) had become heavily oxidized and likely were putting out much less light then when they were new. The restoration kit used a 3 step treatment involving a de-oxidation step (involving multiple treated wipes to chemically remove the oxidation layer), a step that follows this by preparing the headlights (by a medium and separate fine sanding of the surfaces of the headlights) for a hard ceramic coating, and then applying that ceramic coating to the treated headlights. I had had these headlights \"treated\" at my Toyota dealer previously and found that that treatment had a minimal impact and degraded soon afterwards. The Ceracote treatment returned the headlights to their original cleanliness. Great product......",

But, it did take the dull, yellowish hue and turn it back to clear, making them both look SO much better. I was able to use half and save the rest for later, just in case.

        "content": "I’m pleased to report these work well for me. They fit well, are sturdy and comfortable, and they feel safe because there are no gaps. They seem to last awhile, too, which I like because I don’t want to add a ton of non-biodegradable masks to landfill. I prefer to keep several masks in rotation, airing them when they are not in use, so that I can re-use them. (It’s 3years into the pandemic, I live in NYC and ride the subway, yet haven’t gotten Covid yet.)\n\nI would buy these again. I searched like crazy for masks on a par with a very expensive type my mother-in-law kindly sent us at the beginning of the pandemic. This is the first mask I’ve found that matches those for sturdiness, durability, fit, and safety.\n\nThese measure 6-3/8 inches from top to bottom (measuring from point to point of the folded mask) and 4-1/4 inches from the widest point side to side on a folded mask. Unfolded, that would be 8-1/2 inches wide.\n\nThe design is such that the masks come deeply under my chin, which I like because it provides great coverage. I have what I’d describe as a medium sized face. I do find these masks comfortable—however, I do not put the ear loops around my ears. Rather, I use a lace and tie the mask on in back, using the ear loops. I find wearing masks this way to be far more comfortable, and I can control how tight I want the mask to be.\n\nMy only minor complaint is that these masks smell a bit mildewed straight out of the box. To address this, I leave the mask in a sunny window 24 hours before wearing it. A very faint smell lingers. For that reason, if half stars were available, I’d give these 4.5 stars. But on consideration, I decided not to knock off a star, because I’m so pleased with these for all the reasons that are most important to me.",

        "content": "I'm long winded, so I'll give you the punchline first:\n\nFor the price, these masks:\n1] are much better than I expected\n\n2] have some amount of variation in strap length that doesn't matter for my shape/size of face but could matter for small faces\n\n3] have all the \"right\" markings, although to me that's no guarantee of a mask not being counterfeit\n\n4] are lightweight and comfortable for my face\n\n5] don't seal wonderfully around the bridge of my nose when exhaling; fogs up glasses/sunglasses. Seems to seal fine when inhaling. In other words, low risk of outside air sneaking in unfiltered, highly likely unfiltered exhaled air from you would get out. Don't wear these around your high risk grandma if you are trying to protect her from you.\n\n6] definitely have 5 distinct layers (see picture).\n\nLong-winded verson:\nAs with any commercial product nowadays, it's hard to know what to expect after reading reviews. The most vocal and emotional reviewers are generally those that get a crappy product and are understandably upset. When I'm shopping for the best value version of any cheap, mass produced item, I fully expect there to be some percentage of products that made it out the door with defects.\nThat said, the box of Funight masks that I just received are much better than I expected. I haven't opened every single mask up, so there may be some in this box that have some of the issues mentioned in other reviews (ear straps that easily detach for instance), but so far so good. At this price, I'll be happy if 3/4 of these don't have defects.\nI don't claim to be a filtration expert, but I know enough about filtration media to know that the type of material matters much more than the amount. In this case, for anyone basing their choice on these masks having 5 layers as advertised, they do; I attached a picture of a section cut out showing all 5 layers seperated. I wouldn't have been too surprised if they didn't at this price, but hey, I'll take it!\nAlso, all of the \"correct\" markings (\"KN95\" and \"GB 2626-2019\") are thermally compressed into the mask, not that I personally think that means anything. I can't imagine there is some reason that counterfeiters can't put the right markings on their masks; relying on that as an indicator of masks being legitimate makes about as much sense as looking for markings that say \"counterfeit\" on counterfeit masks.\nThese Funight masks are really comfortable for me, and do a great job of sealing around my face, except up over my nose, where they do allow some air to flow out and fog up any glasses/sunglasses I might be wearing. They're no worse than the accordian/surgeon style masks I've worn previously though.\nThey are comfortable over my nose, but all masks I've tried that don't have an extra strip of rubber/foam to help seal don't do a very good job for me, even some very uncomfortably tight N95 masks don't get this part right. For reference, I'd guess I have a medium size face/head for a man.\nI have recently tried some 3M 9205+ masks that seal amazingly well over my nose while still being comfortable in that area. There are other drawbacks though; mainly price (about 4x the price of these Funights) but also they aren't nearly as comfortable to me as these KN95 style masks with earloops instead of full head straps. I use the 3M N95 masks if I feel the situation is more critical; i.e. I'm in a high risk area (crowded with lots of random people) or if I'm getting on an airplane.\nI bought these Funight masks to use in more \"everyday\" situations that I don't expect to be particularly high risk, but I'd like to be wearing something more effective than a cloth mask or a single or double layer accordion style mask.\nThe only quality control issue I've seen thus far is, as lots of other reviews have mentioned, the ear loop lengths vary noticeably from one mask to another. Thus far all of the lengths have been fine for me; none have been too tight; some have been a little loose but putting one twist in the ear loop has been enough to get it just right. The straps seem to have a lot of stretch, so the batch I have would probably be fine for someone with a larger head than me, but might be too loose for someone with a really small face/head.",

I also wear glasses so it adds extra pressure. If you’re wearing the mask on and off then you’ll be fine. Just keep in mind that keeping the mask for entender period of time may lead to external ear pain or cuts. The mask itself is good but at times can feel like your just breathing your own air and that no air is able to escape through the very faint openings.",

The ear straps inevitably made my ears a bit sore, but especially with a 10 hour flight I think that is to be expected.

They are durable and I was never bothered or annoyed with them, they worked very well. The only thing is my ears getting sore, but there is probably a work around for that and also likely going to happen with any mask.

So maybe 6 short sentences per day. On the first day of use, I completed my 6 short sentences and then noticed my fingers were coated in the ink. I figured i grabbed a dud and the rest will be fine.\nI just grabbed out a 4th pen today and once again, my hands are coated in purple ink about 2 sentences in. So 2 out of the 4 that I have used, leak almost immediately. I am not pressing hard, throwing the pens around or anything similar.\n\nSooooooo, love the pens that work as they should. I am assuming that about half of these pens are leaky and the other half might be as described",

Tiene una buena calidad en términos de la flexibilidad, diseño, intensidad de luz, y app. Aunque huele un poco feo recién salido de la caja.\n\nEn realidad es un buen producto, solo que requiere de varias consideraciones al momento de usar.\n\nPor ejemplo, es mejor la luz indirecta que directa. Por eso la tira es mejor ubicarla de forma oculta para que no se vean los LEDs. Pareciera obvio, pero aún así pasa.\n\nEs preferible cortar la tira según lo que necesitamos que gastarla toda y tener una luz saturada o mediocre.\n\nRecomiendo ubicar la luz LED sin pegarla para ver como se ve la luz en la estética general antes de empezar a pegarla porque aunque es fácil de remover con un poco de fuerza puede que se rompa. Además el adhesivo es tan bueno que se vuelve imposible poder guardarlo de nuevo.\n\nPor eso una vez se empiece a pegar es mejor estar seguros de dónde queremos que quede.\n\nLas tiras que sobren sirven para después ya sea para alargar tramos de LED o para aplicar en otros lugares. Solo toca comprar los componentes adicionales para ello.",

I should have listened to the reviews because about 50 feet of the entire roll has stopped working. And some of the strip is colors it shouldn’t be. I’ve had LED strips in the past that lasted years!

Make it easy on yourself, unroll a bit with the adhesive still on and hold it up where you want it. While holding it in place, pull the protective strip away and press the strip to the wall. This keeps you from having sections that are not quite lined up. Keep repeating unrolling a bit more and progressing down the wall while removing small portions of the protective strip until you are done. The remote is basic and needs LOS (it's an IR remote).

        "content": "There is a long distance from my home to my company, I usually drive for work and business travel. So I like to look through Amazon to find some car accessories which would make my driving process more convenient and comfortable. This time I purchased the Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler and YRU Car Phone Holder and both of them really enhanced my driving experience.\n\nThe Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler was used to resolve the issue with phones, keys and other items falling into areas that are difficult to reach between the front seats and console and I'm extremely pleased with the effect.  Since I purchased the YRU Car Phone Holder, I habitually put my phone in the phone holder when I get in the car, it literally has saved me hundreds of times from dropping my employee card, keys,or any item falling off underneath the seat.\n\nWhen it comes to the YRU Leather Panel Car Phone Holder, I have to say it's an accessory that helps me drive safer, this little mountable phone holder for the car is so easy to install and dependable, I just took a few minutes to attach the holder which has a very powerful suction to the dashboard of my car. The cell phone is at a good height and the long arm of the holder is just the perfect distance for me to reach my phone without looking down. For the hundreds of times I have put my phone in and taken it out it has never loosened. It is easy to squeeze the side arms to set the phone then squeeze again to release it. I can easily tilt it up, down, to the right or left to place it so I can see and hear my GPS system or speak hands free and avoid to pull my eyes far away from the road to make me drive safer. I feel safer with my phone in such a secure holder, I would definitely recommend this product!\n\nAbout Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler, Each package comes with 2 Drop Stops (1 for the driver side and 1 for the passenger side; universal fit). You also get two bonus gifts; a Slide Free Pad and an LED Credit Card Light. The sellers are very generous and the bonus gifts are very practical.\n\nWhen I eat something in my car it is difficult to avoid some food falling down in the gap between the front seats and console that I couldn't reach, I couldn't reach it with the vacuum, and it was just a mess. Since getting the Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler, I don't have such distress anymore! Not to mention, when I drop my phone, bottle lids, Air pod, etc. down the crack between the seat and armrest and can't reach it, now everything just lands on this gap filler and is easy to pick up.\n\nIn addition to avoiding the hassle of dropping something under your seat, there is a safety factor here - avoiding bending my head to look for something that fell while driving. I like the YRU phone holder also because of the safety factor, with the phone holder, I’ve been able to put my phone very close to my line of sight and avoid taking my eyes off the road while driving.\n\nI highly recommend the Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler and YRU Car Phone Holder. Sometimes, a small investment can make driving safer and more comfortable.",

        "content": "This is the second set of these we have purchased. It's a very simple solution to one of those PIA things we've all encountered - having something fall out of your pocket when you are driving and end up trapped between your seat and the center console. If you're lucky you'll have a lot of room under the seat to grab whatever you dropped out from under the seat. If not, you'll find yourself practically lying on the back seat floor shredding your arm to pieces trying to fish your item out among the wiring and metal seat frame.\nThese gap fillers work perfectly to prevent this from happening and seem to fit just about any car. Installation takes nothing more than putting the seat belt buckle through the hole in gap filler and then push it into the space between the seat cushion and the center console. It's as simple as that and you'll never have to go fishing for things under the seat again. Best of all, they last forever and you can move them from car to car. Highly recommended.",

It's not like I drop a lot of stuff, or even very often, but when I have it was always such a mission to fish out whatever it was. Naturally if it was change, pens or French fries that found their way into those gaps they just stayed there like a layer of synthetic landfill, but keys and/or the cell phone down there always meant a reconnaissance mission, usually at time, or place that was very inconvenient. NO MORE! Ok, so it's not a necessity, really, but I'm just very pleased to not have to deal with this kind of thing anymore :) I'll be getting some for gifts too!!",

I dropped one star from the ease of installation because I can't seem to get it installed on the driver's side. That is probably my fault because I have to sit in the seat to install anything and that probably pushes the cushion a bit to the side leaving less space to install this. I may update this if I can get someone else to lean over and install it or do it from the passenger seat. This is nothing b ut a bit of sturdy foam with a durable-appearing cover and a slot for the seatbelt anchor but it is certainly worth the price compared to the hours it would take me to make one from scratch - definatly would recommend.",

They were a little tight and I had to push hard to put them in, but I think that’s a good thing because it really fills in the gap. It works.

I stuffed them in pretty far so they’d sit level with the center console, and the seatbelt cut-out was perfectly positioned. I’m very happy with this; it’s helping me maintain my goal of keeping my car clean.",

So, of course it got worse.\n\nNow, if you're wearing jeans or work pants, the cracks aren't a big issue. But if you're wearing any pants/shorts of any thinner material, that cracked vinyl finds the perfect angle to be a constant uncomfortable presence during your entire drive.\n\nI cleaned the area first with some cleaning wipes, then again with some alcohol. I tried to hold the crack together as I applied the repair tape, and in areas that had factory seams/creases, I tried to make sure the tape made contact all the way into the crease, and not bridge over it.\n\nI installed it 2 or 3 months back, and it's still holding up. I was worried about If the tape would roll and try to stick to my pants, or if I would just end up sitting in the same cracked seat only now with a bunch of adhesive residue all over it, etc. It has held together great so far. I don't see any movement.\n\nNow, It doesn't look great, But if I cared about that, I wouldn't have bought the truck with vinyl seats in the first place. I can tell you the color is a bit off, and the texture is different. Again, if you really care about any of this, why are you even looking at this product? Just fix the seat and put a seat cover on it I suppose, or have it reupholstered professionally.",

The guide for the installation was spot on in the position of the protector on the screen and the screen went on with 0 bubbles!!! Which is amazing because I basically dropped the protector on the screen without carefully lowering it from one side to another like you are usually supposed to. I have never ever had an easier time installing any screen protector.\nI purchased this for an iPhone 13 so I can’t say anything about the fingerprint reader. I also am not inclined to drop my phone or scratch the protector just to test it but the protector does feel like good solid glass and the screen is super responsive.\nThe protector that goes on the camera is also great and super easy to put on. Again no bubbles and doesn’t interfere with the pic quality at all! I tried night time photography in very low light and the photos were crystal clear. I ended up removing the camera protector (removal is easy as well) because I use my phone carefully and have I would have the peace of mind that nothing interferes with my pic quality. But if one is inclined to add additional protection to the cameras these protectors are simply the best.",

It helps to: 1) be in as clean a place as you can, 2) ask everyone to stay out of the room while you work. With this kit and any protector, the smallest bit of dust becomes a bulls-eye that will make you unhappy.\n\nIt helps to power down your phone so it's not wondering what your fingers are trying to tell it during this process.\n\nWhat's remarkable about this set is the frame that helps you position the glass. That's the only part of the process that anyone can make work better for you, and this frame really did help.\n\nAfter the glass is down, you take off the frame and move bubbles out until they're gone. The screen looks great and the touchscreen is fully responsive.\n\nGood product!",

Either way, your phone is important to you – acknowledge that importance by purchasing this (if not this kind) of screen protector.\n\nThe QHOQH iPhone screen protector (SP) is a tempered glass sheet cut specifically for the 13 and 14 screens to protect them from direct contact and provides a long-wearing buffer from scratches and impacts while maintaining the premium feel of an iPhone screen. Speaking of the feel, the SP edges are rounded off and the whole screen is coated in a fingerprint-resistant finish that further enhances the smooth glide of fingers across the screen. Installation is literally a snap! The included plastic template locks onto your phone and by aligning the SP to any edge, you can have it installed perfectly, providing complete screen coverage for the entire screen. Still not enough of a sell for you? QHOQH also provides an SP for the camera lens for the ultimate protection for uncomfortably large cameras. For its cost and in so many ways, it just feels like it was made for the iPhone.\n\nThe feature that stood out was its total protection. With the iPhone screen being as expensive and important as it is, it boggles my mind trying to understand why most SPs have a notch cut out for the front camera area. While I can only hypothesize at one time SPs interfered with the forward-facing cameras, those problems have been long resolved, and protecting those camera lenses is more important than ever with the introduction of face ID. Additionally, the SP notch will collect debris as it moves about in a pocket or purse. Fortunately, the QHOQH SP is one of the few that provides complete coverage because like you, they think every part of the screen is important enough to be protected.\n\nIn general, The QHOQH SP is a great choice for readers who would like to get the most out of their phones. Coupled with a durable case, this SP will provide months, if not years of protection from the grubby, clumsy hands of children to more serious drops and falls an adult can achieve and still look good while it is happening. I suppose you can keep looking for other SPs but don’t go for the cheapest ones but also don’t go overboard buying the most expensive for literally one – this QHOQH SP is a great compromise of everything you need in a great SP",

        "content": "I bought the HOTOR 3-gallon car trash can. FIRST, I'll tell you that the trash can is great and even better than I'd hoped. It will definitely do the job I want it to do, and it will be very easy to maintain since the removeable bags will keep it clean. It's large enough to also serve another function very specific to our needs that is totally different from that of a trash can. Let me explain. My wife has had MS since May 1975 and is now confined to a power chair. We had an Acura MDX with a lift for her chair, but we had to trade it for a van that has ramp she can drive her chair into and then anchor it into a locking system in the passenger side. It's when she's not with me that I realized there was a problem. I had pulled into a fast-food restaurant and ordered food to take home. So far so good. The problem? When they handed me the bag of food, I turned to put them in the passenger seat, and ... then realized that there was none! I drove home carefully, but the bag skidded all over the van from front to back and side to side! You see, there's no carpet since the power chair would tear it up. The floor is a durable, smooth surface and works well for the chair and works well if your food wants to leave sandwiches and French fries all over the van! Back to the trash can. After getting it, I found that, with the top opened, the can works perfectly well as a place to put beside the driver's seat and a fast-food bag fits in it quite nicely. I keep clean bags in it thanks to Lily in Customer Service. That (finally, right) brings me to the SECOND thing and the best thing about my purchase. Folks, the customer service I've received has been nothing except fantastic! What did I contact Customer Service you ask? Not any problem with the garbage can. It's great. My issue was that I bought the 3-gallon can and I wanted to buy a supply of HOTOR 3-gallon bags for it. All I could find was links to buy their 2-gallon bags. So, I had the great experience of contacting Lily in HOTOR Customer Service asking for help. Ladies and gentlemen, she has been extraordinary to say the least! First, she told me that she was just going to send me 50 replacement bags that fit my 3-gallon can ... for free. And she did. Then she sent me a link to use for getting more bags. It was then that she told me that their 2-gallon bags also fit the 3-gallon can! They're big enough. I suggested to Lily that she might pass along my suggestion to those who do their Internet marketing that they mention on their 3-gallon can links that you can use the bags advertised as 2-gallon bags. She thought that was a good idea. I hope someone else thinks so too. Suffice it to say that I've had 14 emails back and forth with Lily and each time she has been helping me with suggestions, soliciting feedback from me, or asking for suggestions how to make their product better, etc. No matter what time of night (e.g., even 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM) I'd email her I'd get a reply almost immediately. The woman never sleeps! She has promised to help me whenever I might need something in the future no matter what it is. So, to summarize, the trash can is terrific, the bags are great and the magnets to hold them in are very nice, BUT the Customer Service is actually unbelievable! Although I don't see a problem you'll have with their products, even if you do have a problem or a question, you'll never have one that Lily won't solve for you ... no matter what time of day (or night) it might be!",

        "content": "I just wanted a trash bag to dispose tissue's, napkins, receipts, and other small items. If you don’t recycle cans and water bottles, then they would fit if you crushed them first. It is a very small bag and I placed it hanging on the center console touching the middle bump on the floor of the rear passenger area. If your center console does not have an area to support the bag, then it would probably be best to hang it on the front passenger seat head rest that could also annoy a large passenger in the rear seat. It accepts all thin produce bags we all use to bag our vegetables in the store, and it uses a button magnet to hold the disposable bags.\nI purchased two of them and one was sealed perfectly and the other was crushed under the vacuum seal of the packaging. Anyone at a quality control position should have noticed it immediately at the assembly line. I provided the picture of how it was delivered. I took one star off due to the wrinkles it created and the time it took to try to make it look descent. It still looks wrinkled but since it’s a trash bag, I decided its not worth the effort to return.\nThe only optional thing it has to install are a set of plastic inserts to make the bag look stiffer. If you install them, they must be installed from the top side of each side of the nylon straps and behind the nylon straps. You can see that the upper stitches are shorter on the sewed straps to allow the plastic insert to slip in. It requires a bit of effort to bend the plastic strap in order to slip it past the upper stitches which will hold it securely behind the black outer nylon strap. I placed the other two plastic inserts in the bottom of the mesh side pockets. Overall a very nice bag for the car.",

I recently purchased this product and have been incredibly impressed with its performance.\nFirst and foremost, the container is incredibly sturdy and durable. It's made of high-quality materials that can withstand even the bumpiest of car rides. Additionally, the container is the perfect size - it's compact enough to fit in even the smallest of cars, yet large enough to hold plenty of trash.\nOne of my favorite features of the Hotay car trash container is its convenient design. It comes with a detachable strap that allows you to easily attach it to your car's headrest, making it easily accessible from the front and back seats. The container also has a secure lid that keeps trash from spilling out while you're on the go.\nAnother great aspect of the Hotay car trash container is how easy it is to clean. It's made of materials that are simple to wipe down, and the container's removable interior liner can be washed and dried quickly.\nOverall, I can't recommend the Hotay brand car trash container enough. It's a durable, convenient, and easy-to-use product that has made my car rides much more enjoyable. If you're in the market for a car trash container, look no further than Hotay!",

After I gifted her this trashcan, she was able to put it inside her car and you do get flexibility on where you want to hang this trashcan, and it does give you a good amount of leg room for anyone that is sitting in the backseat.\n\nIt is very convenient to have this trashcan because now she uses it for her child, herself and her husband who regular puts trash in this trashcan and empties it out, they did buy small trash bags from dollar tree to put in this trashcan. It has been a couple of months now that she has tried this trashcan and loves it.\n\nSo in this case I totally recommend this product to anyone that needs a trashcan in their car.",

If I have more than one person in the back seat of my Jeep Cherokee (smaller SUV), I will need to remove it, but that's ok. If you have kids, it will work fine; but for an adult sitting in the back seat, it will encroach into their space (depending upon how far back the passenger seat is, of course). I love the design with the magnetic snaps that hold the bags. That will help so much. I did need to snip the plastic stays that go underneath the strips of webbing on each side. They are about 1/4 Inch too long. And you will need some work scissors (really strong ones) to cut them. Luckily I had some. Regular scissors, Nail Clippers, Jewelry Nippers will not work.

Attaching any trashbag is easy with the magnets and I haven't had one unattached despite stuffing my Taco Bell bag inside. It does take me some time to attach the bag but magnets are hard okay? The strap to attach to my passenger seat doesn't slack and the pockets are quite sturdy and able to handle the bottle of Dasani water barely good enough for my dog. It's been a few months and a stench hasn't invaded my car. YE",

It takes a full minute to change the bags with the necessity to roll the lip of the bag around four plastic bars and snap them in place with the magnetic snaps but the results are worth the effort for my application. I use four gallon bags as that gives me room to stuff it and still tie the bags off firmly before compacting them with my size 11 trash compactor foot in a battery box for storage to await next port call for disposal.",

        "content": "I formerly gave this HP Multipurpose paper a 5-star recommendation. My life is full of (self-created) clutter, requiring numerous car trips for small objects--from ballpoints to markers to Scotch tape to frozen waffles to paper--lots of it, for the bathroom, office, and music studio. I wouldn't recommend this HP paper for the first of the aforementioned applications, but it serves me well in the other two areas. As copy paper, it moves through my printer without a hitch, readily absorbing ink and producing a sharp and clear final draft. As music manuscript paper, it's got enough fiber to stand up on its own on a piano ledge or music stand (many are the times that an overly thin sheet simply wilts and folds in half with no help from me). Last, the packet is a full 500 sheets (some of the store brand \"value packs\" show an attractive price--until the small print reveals a total of 400 sheets).\n\nUntil a couple of days ago, ordering this essential product from Amazon was a no-brainer, making it not only convenient but more economical to have the paper delivered right to my front door. But, perhaps not surprisingly, the price has more than doubled and the good feelings accordingly down a peg. Still, given the distance of my closest supplier and my tendency to motor out for a single item at a time, ordering the paper (but far less often) at its current price isn't out of the question.\n\nAnother, at least partial, solution would be to reduce the clutter with the cooperation of manufacturers and suppliers. The makers of so many of the appliances, media devices, technological toys and gadgets (including software programs) could contribute considerably toward a more manageable environment by returning to that rapidly vanishing artifact--the printed manual, or instruction booklet. From the iPad to the Kindle (with its 200-page online manual) to every downloaded MP3 music file, the assumption is--I'm not exactly sure--perhaps that we'll save the information to our computer desktops or that we'll happily print it out or that we'll read the online instructions and remember them later or that an instruction booklet would be sufficiently intimidating to prevent us from using the device or that even the most venerable among us will somehow catch up with a younger generation that can be incredibly intuitive about many of these devices and highly impatient with (if not altogether indifferent toward) printed instructions.",

        "content": "Here’s what I have in the vacuum bags, and the size everything fits in.\n\nVacuum bags info :\n\n1 jumbo : king size comforter (still had plenty of room to add a sheet set or smaller blanket)\n1 jumbo : king size comforter, King size sheets (flat, fitted, 4 king pillow cases) (full)\n1 large : queen comforter, queen size sheets (flat, fitted 2 queen pillow cases) (full)\n1 large : 1 full/queen size blanket (thick) and 2 full size crochet blankets (could fit maybe another blanket)\n1 medium : Queen/full comforter (kinda thick/fluffy) and still had room.\n\n*The pump worked fine for the bags. You will be there for a couple of minutes “pumping” the air out, but it’s kinda fun/stress relieving (at least it was for me) but if you have a vacuum (with a hose) it would definitely be faster.\n*The bags seem thick and zip well. If you’ve used the ziplock space bags, (it’s definitely a slightly different type of plastic used) but I’d say these bags feel thicker and slighter more durable than ziplock. (Also cheaper for the amount you get) I had a ziplock storage bag and the plastic ended up tearing by the zipper, I don’t feel like I’ll have that issue with these bags.\n*I have not yet used the “small” bags, or the roll compression bags. I was able to fit everything in the other bags. But I have no doubt they will work just as fine as the other. However since the roll compression bags don’t have cap to be vacuum sealed (from my understanding you just roll the bag and air gets pushed out the other end “compressing” the bag) I can’t say how well that works, or if at all. But I’m sure it’ll be fine for smaller items like clothes or what not, maybe not for big or thicker blankets. But I haven’t tried it yet.\n\nOver all if I need to buy more bags, I will continue to buy these. I feel like it’s a good price for the amount that you get, good quality and comes with its own pump. Great for if you travel and what your items vacuum sealed but you have no vacuum handy.\n\n***(Photo of all the bags stacked : on the far right are the 2 jumbo (white, & red and black checkered) the bottom 2 on the left are the large and there’s a medium stacked on top of them.)",

        "content": "Okay, in my head, I THOUGHT this product would be great, air gone, ease of packing. In REALITY, it didn’t go like I pictured. I pack my suitcases to their size, meaning; using all the nooks, crannies and up to the edges (even that space between the handles INSIDE the suitcases of today (usually filling it with undies, socks, tank tops etc). Well, it’s hard to compress your items by hand while rolling. The air outlet is sometimey, (I flipped the bag over, straightened out the seal etc, before IT got the idea of what I was trying to do. Second, (and this is on ME), IF I put neat, pressed and wrinkle free clothes in the bag, ROLLING THEM, to get the air out; is NOW a problem (so I tried to lay them in flat and stacked, roll the plastic THEN had to sit on the clothes to get the remaining air out (it worked, but that whole process was IT for me). I used 4 bags out of 20 and quit. Finding out even with the air out, the bag is flat and does not utilize the nooks and and crannies of my suitcase was even a NO for me. They would me MORE appropriate if they were being used for storage of sheets and other flat items, but again getting the air out is a straight hassle. The zip closure popped off the 1st time I tried the 1st bag and I thought I broke it, but it slipped back on easily to reseal the bag. I put a king sized blanket in first. Maybe I should have just tried the clothes, because THIS HAND STRUGGLE is NOT it… Use one with a vacuum IF you gotta do it, but I know I won’t be using them for traveling.",

        "content": "Came with all of the parts and on time without any damage!\nThe jumbo bags really are...JUMBO. I got this for a trip to pack all of my belongings in a relatively small suitcase and I really only needed to use 1 roll up, 1 small, and 1 medium. There were a few comments that were complaining that they were sent a set of bags without the suction valve, but I guess they failed to realize that they were roll-up compression bags? I don't know. The roll up bags work pretty well although they do require a big of pressure. When I first started rolling them nothing was happening but you have to apply consistent and pretty firm pressure and then you start hearing the air release at the bottom of the bag.\n\nIf I am being picky, I don't like how the bags turn really crumpled once you actually open them after they've been compressed but it's really not a big deal. The hand pump works fine...it just takes a really long time. In the absence of a vacuum cleaner, I would recommend manually squeezing as much air out as possible first and then completely sealing the bag AND THEN using the hand pump.\n\nAlso if you are trying to use a medium sized bag in a smaller container, once you put the clothes/items inside, fold it in half and then vacuum so that it conforms to a smaller shape.\n\nI will try to update this after my trip.",

The convenience of not needing to squeeze all the air out eliminates the concern to pop open the zip lock seal OR squish all of your clothes into the base of the bag (which naturally happens when you try to push & roll the air out).\n\nBeing able to layer items, place them where needed and then pump the air out allows me to plan packing my suitcase more efficiently. I love knowing if a toiletry item leaks, my clothes are safe and smaller items like chargers and my toothbrush is easier to find in a pinch. I even was able to use these bags to pack my king size pillow into my carryon with room for everything else around it because you can suck the air out of the pillow (I'm picky on my pillow comfort when traveling).",

        "content": "Very good quality vacuum bags for the price. Bought the 30 pack. Handpump works fantastically.\n\nI remember buying the Amazon Basics version of these a few years ago - they fell apart after a few uses, plastic cracked and ripped through.\n\nThese seem to be a much thicker, sturdier plastic and I have faith they will last much longer. I also paid like 40 for 8 of them at the time, so it is good to see that the price has been reduced drastically.\n\nBeen reading the reviews - want to set people straight on a few things. If you are finding that the bags regain air after a few days: make sure you're leaving at least two inches at the end. If you're applying too much pressure right at the zipper, you're bound to get a leak.\n\nAlso, it's not a one and done zipper.\n\nRun it back and forth a few times with the clip, and then with a good hard finger squeeze for good measure.\n\nMost vacuums don't have enough suction to pull all the air out, so you're probably gonna use the hand pump at the end just to get it as flat as you can - make sure you're not overdoing it. Check the little rubber stopper in the center when you're done. If it looks deformed, then you've created too much negative pressure inside the bag and ruined the seal. If you put the cap on its going to keep it deformed and able to suck in tiny bits of air at random. Lift it and fiddle with it until it is perfectly round and centered. If you need to start over, do so. You don't want to open a storage unit full of inflated bags, it's awful, trust me. Like putting a light bulb in your mouth, it'll go in, but it won't come out.\n\nAnd finally, make sure your cap is nice and snug.\n\nGreat product, will probably order more.\n\nShould say however, it has no packaging. It just is a shipping sticker slapped on the product box. As I live in a very wet, snowy area, I was a bit annoyed with that.",

        "content": "So when I opened the product I was pretty skeptical. Not only had I not paid much for the whole kit (which is suspicious all on its own :) ) but the plastic felt thin, \"crunchy\" and the top seal was basically what seemed like a cheap ziplock seal. BUT I grabbed the giant heavy fleece blanket from atop the couch, stuck one it, closed it up (the slider puts the top edges together, but you still have to pinch the edges together a la ziplock) and figured I'd try the little plastic pump before likely having to get out the vacuum five seconds later. Nope. That lil guy had the air sucked out in under a minute, and voila! So now not only can I put away all the extra comforters etc, but with the diff sizes, I can store the kids old clothes,the winter coats and snow pants that take up a giant Rubbermaid in the closet, and so many other things! As a screenprinter, I also have a lot of blank shirts in storage, that take up space and still somehow manage to get ruined in the basement air even contained in boxes or bins! And the fact that the little pump actually works means I could use it wherever and not have to worry about having an air compressor or some such nonsense around. I'm having a truly adult moment here, gushing about great storage solutions, and I couldn't care less :)\nEdit: after the initial excitement and taking them all out, I realized that 4 of the smaller sized bags didn't have the pump pieces on them..just 4 lrg ziplock bags. I use one to store the rest of the bags in..the rest look like they could be for pillows, but they may be a little small for any that I have. I'd check the box for an explanation, but it was soaked thru when the Amazon delivery driver didn't read the delivery note of 'put inside back porch bc extreme storm approaching' lol. I still love the bags but I needed to mention this, and the fact that I'm not super positive of how many times the bags will be able to be used. When I took the blanket out, the bag was of course, no longer smooth and whatnot, but it made me worry about the thin-ness of the plastic again. Again, this is still one of my favorite things, I just want to be 100% on this review :) So should they fall apart after being re-used a few times, you'll hear about it here :)",

Suction Device is straight forward, place items in bag, try to lay flat so everything doesn't curl up, screw in pump, and pump until air is satisfactorily vacated. I only used the provided pump so cannot comment on how attaching vacuum works. Partly my fault for not looking closer, but I was disappointed that the 4 roll up bags do not have a suction port and cannot be used for vacuum sealing.

You need to slip the closure several times to make sure you have a good seal. The closure falls of easily but does also go back on just as easily.

        "content": "OK, let's clear up a few things:\n1) I am a real buyer, was not given this pillow, was not paid to review this pillow. There's no way I'm doing any of that.\n2) I want everyone to know exactly what I'm giving an opinion on. This \"Beckham Hotel\" pillow is the very same as others called \"Sleep Restoration Super Plush Gel-Fiber Filled Pillows\". That's what the package the two pillows (costing $35 total) came in reads, and there's a small bar-coded sticker with tiny writing indicating the Beckham Hotel re-branding.\n3) There's NO smell. There's NO mildew. They arrived factory clean and shipped in a nice, zipped plastic container bag.\n4) They arrive dead flat. When you remove them, they start to fluff up. I'd say after an hour or so they are ready to use. Fluff them a bit, and you can sleep on them right away. It's not necessary to put them in a dryer and in fact it could be detrimental. Not sure.\n5) I waited a month to write this because I wanted to be sure I liked the pillows. I do!\n6) I had some doubts at first because I thought they'd be too soft, but after a couple of nights I would now describe them as soft, yet firm enough to support my head and neck correctly. I start out sleeping on my side and of course, at some point end up on my back, and then often back on my side.\n7) They're heavy enough to no move around, but not heavy like a (solid) memory foam pillow is. They stay put in other words.\n8) I purchased the queen sized ones. Now, it was sort of interesting to me that these are 20 inches wide, and yet a queen size pillowcase is also 20 inches wide. Yet, a pillow is quite high and a pillowcase is of course - flat. This means it requires some effort to squeeze the pillow into the pillowcase. BUT, perhaps this makes the pillow seem a bit firmer than my initial impression of it was in paragraph #6. At any rate, it works and these have worked out well for me.\n9) I woke up in a hotel about 4 years ago with neck pain and had it ever since. All sorts of chiropractic efforts, daily neck stretches, painkillers, etc. just didn't seem to get rid of it. I ditched my Tempur-Pedic s-shaped solid memory foam pillow and tried several other pillows I got locally. They all went back. I got these pillows, continued on the daily neck stretches and now I'm feeling fine with no more neck pain. I noticed about a week ago I was waking up with no more neck pain. That's a relief.\n\nThat's about all I can tell you Amazon shoppers. Buying a pillow is a wilderness of choice. I spent a LOT of hours on here looking. And of course pillows, and the comfort of them, is very personal and subjective. I can only say, for me, these worked out. If they don't for you, I assume you can return them, possibly with some shipping cost. I don't know. I'm not a regular Amazon customer and not a Prime member.\nBest of luck finding yours!\n-MSW",

        "content": "I have been searching for a pillow that holds and supports but also is soft &comfy. I've tried expensive memory foam and temperpedic pillows and they are always too hard even though your head \"sinks \" in. I just want alot of fluff but not feel like the pillow flattens 2 weeks later.\nIt's been 3 months so far and the pillow STILL retains it's shape and original height. I co sleep with my 2 year old and the pillows always have a lot of body weight on them and constant movement, but they still support and hold !!! That awkward gap between your neck and the bed is filled with this pillow because it maintains it's height and fluff and doesn't sink down too much. I always make sure before bed I obsessively HAVE to grab this pillow and I put them in special pillow cases so I always know where they are on the bed and which to grab.\nI thought the price was decent considering you get 2 good pillows.\n\nCons: a possible con is if someone doesn't like this style of pillow. Everyone is different and needs something different from their pillow. If you are the kind of person who likes that memory foam /temperpedic pillows, then this pillow probably isn't for you. If youre someone always trying to layer super soft pillows up under your head, because you like the softness but also need the support - this pillow may work for you.\nI would say this is on the SOFT side for pillows - not for those who don't want their heads to sink in. However, because the softness is layered up so high and has a great width/THICKNESS, your head and neck gap will also feel supported. If you don't want a puffy/high pillow, and prefer flatter thinner ones - this probably isn't for you. !\nThese pillows were def. A hit for me! And I noticed much better sleep even just after the first night. I have to be raised higher to sleep now because my son sleeps better when I'm boosted up at an incline. I was so tired of stacking a million pillows that didn't feel that soft anyway. This takes care of that problem !\n\nI gave 4 stars because a product can always be improved. I never do 5 stars unless a product is the most perfect it could ever be. Plus, like I said, the quality will be objective as what works for one person in a pillow may not work for another. Overall, disregarding that, and in general , it's a well made comfortable pillow in general.",

        "content": "I really bought the pillows with no promotion or incentives for my own personal use. First of all, I have 3 cervical-spine fusions so my neck support is critical. I have bought every price-range pillow out there including feather, gel,foam,hybrid,down and mixed materials, etc.. I usually end up cutting open my pillows and adding or removing filling to get the best comfort. Here is how this one performs. It takes a while to fill out. I put it in the dryer and used it about 6 hours later. It was a bit flat but I used it with a folded towel. Through the night it puffed up a bit more and I removed the towel. It still wasn't quite right. So I inserted the queen size pillow into a zippered standard size pillowcase. This smaller pillow case caused the filling to be compressed enough to make it feel fuller. Now it's about perfect. I know it won't last. Eventually I will use the 2nd pillow for filling out the 1rst one and continue doing that until I replace them in about a year. This is why I invest in a good zippered pillow cover so I can continuously alter the comfort by increasing the filling. Hope this helps someone out there searching for that perfect pillow. Sleep Well!!",

        "content": "So I feel at this point after spending a thousand or more dollars I should know what a good pillow is. I have a terrible neck with three herniations so it does hurt more often than not.\n\nMy boyfriend started complaining of the same and then I thought that maybe it was because of the pillows since he has no neck issues. So I thought well shoot let’s buy more pillows because well, why not!!\n\nI found these and was excited for all of the reviews. I also thought the price was fair if they didn’t work out no huge loss.\n\nThey came in and were vacuumed sealed. We took them out and let them fluff up, to my surprise there was no odd smell. Once they did fluff up I was skeptical. They were light and fluffy and I honestly did not think they would offer any support based on how they felt. But I said I’ll give it a shot.\n\nHoly moly!!!! I put my head on a cloud of pure happiness. I kept it to myself as to not get my happiness up too much as I’ve felt great on pillows before until I wake up and can’t move my neck.\n\nSo we slept and we slept like babies!!! I mean that. For me I don’t sleep well in general and average 3-4 a night before the pain sets in. These puppies worked!!! Hello 8 hours of sleep!!!\n\nI asked my boyfriend how he slept and if he liked them. He said I think we should buy more, “that’s the best pillow I’ve ever slept on”.\n\nNeedless to say it was well worth the try and the price point. I’m very happy for once with a pillow and you should be as well. If you’re thinking of doing it, just add it to your cart and checkout because I feel sure you will enjoy them just as much as we are.",

For helping with my temperature control issues, they are awesome.\n\nI wear a CPAP at night. These pillows 'resist' the swivel on my full-face CPAP differently than normal pillows. It took me a couple nights to become acclimated. That is a consideration for users, rather than a criticism.

The biggest complaint i have is I like to usually only use one pillow and if you are the same way, you will be slightly disappointed with these. Not supportive at all really and my head sinks to the bottom almost. I have remedied this by using a flatter pillow under one of these at the same time but that misses the point in my opinion.

I really liked this price point and it has such wonderful reviews I thought okay, let's wash them and see what happens. I'm so glad I did because after washing they were perfect! Love that they offer the fold over end to hide the pillow edging, and the end isn't floppy. It looks polished and nice on the bed. The reviews are correct, but them you'll love them!",

Bought this item over and over again when more bags where needed. Every time they worked flawlessly. I'm surprised, as I expected that out of the hundreds of bag, some would have been faulty. However, that was never the case. These bags hold the milk well whether in the fridge, for shot term storage or frozen, for long term storage. They are also easy to pour the milk from the pumps and easy to pour the milk into bottles.\n\n2. Reading the 1 star reviews, usually brings to light some glaring faults in the product. For this product I have read several people having problems with leakage. It made me hesitant before buying first time. However, I never had any leakage happen to me. So my thoughts are that either those people received faulty bags, or have not properly sealed and stored the milk. In case you are wondering how to do it properly - Take out all the air out of the bag before sealing it, then close the double zip-locks. Make sure both are sealed with the air out. For cold storage keep the bags standing or lying (I prefer standing), for frozen storage keep it lying. Never fill it more than what it can hold.\n\nTL:DR\nThese are great bags, bought them over and over when ran out, they don't leak and are easy to store and use.\n\nIn the photo - Left side: A bag with milk from the cold storage. Right Side: A bag with milk from the frozen storage.",

        "content": "I have purchased 3 diff brands of these little portable chargers to find the best one.\nSo I have this I-Walk, a portable INIU (w. flashlight) & 1 Anker portable charger.\nOf them all, the IWALK is THE ABSOLUTE Hands Down BEST OF ALL them, (FOR AN IPHONE ONLY!)\nI say this because I have used mine w my iPhone so unbelievably often!!!\nAND Also because it is so very easy to use & bcuz it is comfortable while ur using it also! Too, It has the updated c plug-in port & all you have to do is just plug it into your phone & then it charges your phone while you are using it! So you can still use your phone while it is plugged into the wall.\nAnd while it’s plugged in, it’s still charging your phone & itself also!\nIt also is so easy to maneuver around when it’s plugged into ur phone. The way it’s formed, where it’s curved, smooth, & not too heavy or unwieldy, fits to ur hand comfortably while it’s plugged into the phone! So I find this one WAY easier to hold & use than all those brick type ones I mentioned that I bought.\nSo… Yes, in my personal opinion, this is an absolute FIND for me!\nAnd because of that, I then purchased this 2nd one as a gift for my sister. She had seen mine & how great it looked, how easy it was to use & to carry around. So she sd “That’s my Xmas present… 1 in green!” ;)\nWhich reminds me— I also was very surprised at how well this pink I-Walk is holding up in my purse. I have had the pink one maybe 2 months now & I don’t have it in anything at all. I just throw it in my purse, and it is surprisingly resilient and resistant to scratches! Which blew me away also as usually light colored items pick up scratches & blemishes so easily! But not this… So I just absolutely adore this little invention bcuz it is so useful, helpful, & handy!\nOk, Onto the Cons: The Only con I have is the price… It is a little high, in my opinion.\nBut it IS a quality product that I use on a (sometimes) daily basis, so I decided it’s well worth the money to me.\nSo…. Bottom Line: Would I buy it again!?!\nYou betcha!!!",

It also charges your phone extremely slowly. I don’t know if it’s because I have an older phone (iPhone 11), but I’ve had it on charging for over an hour now and my battery has gone up only 5%.\nI would see more benefits if it charged faster, but I have had better and faster portable chargers with cords. I bought this to use when I travel and am using my phone a lot or photos and navigation for easier use without a cord, but honestly I wouldn’t recommend this if that is what your intended use is. If you’ll use it to charge your phone and leave it alone for hours in your bag, that’s probably fine!",

This means I needed a sleek, long, and narrow (my old pad covered the cable hole at the top end of my desk) pad that would accommodate my keyboard, mouse, writing needs... oh, and of course a cup of coffee nearby at all times, of course.\n\nThis pad over-delivers! It looks sleek and professional, while performing ideally! Inexpensive doesn't have to mean cheap, and this pad is a real bargain.\n\nYou will probably need to place heavy books on the ends for a couple days once unpackaged, but it's a small price to pay for such a great and well-priced desk pad. I am extremely happy with this purchase!",

Definitely be gentle with it when you are trying to get it to be flat because it does hold any indentions, if not permanently then for a very long time I would assume because the material is very soft. It has an unpleasant chemical smell to it that I’m sure will go away with time but is a little distracting when I’m sitting at my desk. The smell was a lot stronger when I first took it out the package, almost nauseating and gave me a slight headache, but now (12+ hrs later) its still noticeable but tolerable. Can’t speak to how easy it is to clean yet or how long it will last but I do recommend for the price.",

They look nice, are of good quality, the PU leather has a nice texture, and it overall looks quite nice while protecting the top of my wooden desk.\n\nThe only word of warning I would give is that the color varies slightly from what you see in the picture. I bought the dark blue mat to lay on my black desk and the blue is actually a little darker than I expected based on the pictures online. It's not a deal-breaker by any stretch, but it's something to be aware of.\n\nAlso of note, the PU Leather does have a bit more resistance to it than a normal cloth-covered mousepad. Not an issue for me, but something to consider if you really want your mouse to glide over the mat.",

        "content": "UPDATE: The surface of this desk pad is a very nice-looking and feeling fake-leather. Fine... except that that texture also makes it very easy for things to stick and they are not easy to get off. I have been used to a smoother formica-style desk surface and am used to being able to clean it off without effort as it was completely smooth and tough. This surface doesn't work that way, and it's pretty easy to damage the surface if you try to hard. Even using a fingernail to try to loosen something can mar the surface. As indicated below, I think this is a good product. However, I selected the 'pale grey' (which almost perfectly matches my desk surface) and I'm going to order a 'dark blue' one because I think the dark color will hide things like minor discolorations as I won't try so hard to keep it looking perfect as I think less will show on the dark color. Of course, if you never eat or drink or let a ball-point pen point touch the pad, you'll be fine. I did that with a pen, just a tiny little dot, but on the pale grey it stood out.\n\nFor roughly $12/13 this is a very nice product. I got the light gray color as I wanted something that would 'disappear' and my desktop is almost excactly that color. Mine, and I assume all, has a textured finish. It looks and feels nice, though if you spill anything it will be a bit more tedious to clean. I like the fact that it has just a little bit of thickness, but not much, as I got it so that I could rest my hands on the desk while using a mouse but I didn't want anything (like a padded mouse wrist rest) that would elevate my hands more. This provides just the amount of softness that I needed.\n\nOne thing to be ready to do: It arrives rolled up (and nicely boxed) and when you unroll it the end that was on the outside will relax pretty much on its own, as will the rest of it. However, the end that was the inside part of the rolled-up pad gets a little bit... kinked, maybe, and I found that putting things like heavy books completely covering that end and the few inches, and leaving them overnight helped flatten it out nicely. I mention this because my first thought was that maybe it wouldn't flatten out but I figured with over 50,000 good reviews it probably just needed some help and it would be fine, and it has been.",

        "content": "Charger by definition needs battery. The more power packed, the heavier the charger becomes.\n\nThis charger is no difference in terms of weight. It's heft but the size helps making it easier to carry than others. Anker makes the same shape / size as a modern smartphone. This makes it easier to hold while you charge and use your smartphone as needed.\n\nIt's different than other chargers in that it has only one output, an IQ output. There are two inputs - a micro USB and USB C input. I am not sure what the design decision was. But I felt it's overkill. May be it was for the benefit of people who have not migrate to USB-C who still have micro USB cable / charger.\n\nIn regards to the output, you need to find a USB-A cable, which is very common to find and many people probably have a few laying around. However, there is not that many people have USB-C to USB-C cable.\n\nAs some of you know, not all cables are the same. I tried a cable thought it would achieve good result based on past experience. But I got only normal, i.e. slow charging speed. So I switch to another thin cable I have at the moment and voila, it achieves SUPER FAST CHARGING per my S20 FE. Please try different cable if you find it not achieving the speed you expect.\n\nAs for capacity, I am not sure about the 10,000 mAh claim through my limited experience with it. It lose one blue dot, meaning 25% charging my phone. I thought at the time, it doesn't look right as the charge I gained is not 2500 mAh. As you may know, most battery can't reach 100% but 80% efficiency. A very good one may reach 90% or higher.\n\nAll in all, it was OK for the price I paid with the unique feature it provides.",

The other power banks I have still work appropriately and charge themselves and charge items almost the same as they did when they were new.

Based on media reviews I bought this from Anker. Did it charge my phone? Yes, but it’s barely compatible with modern Apple devices. When I went to charge the bank, I found The included cord only has a old style usb end and the other end doesn’t fit in any Apple device or adapter I own. So thankfully I had an old adapter laying around that took usb or I could not have charged it. The cord also doesn’t have a lightening end so I had to use the old Apple cord from the old adapter to charge my devices because the bank won’t charge a device using a lightening to usb-c cord. It only outputs using an old usb. If you use Apple, buy a different brand,",

        "content": "I bought this a few months ago as 'emergency backup', if I happened to be away from a charging source (so, not in a building or car; generally for camping and the like). The battery in my Galaxy S8 has degraded over time, and I wasn't ready to get spendy on a new phone, nor did I look forward to 'cell phone surgery' to replace the battery (the days of popping off the case back and swapping out in a minute or two are long gone, sad to say). So I ordered this up. At 10,000 mAh, I figured I should get enough charge to get me through a jam.\n\nIf you're thinking... \"S8! That's a dinosaur!\" -- you're likely rocking something much more current, and aren't worried about off-grid power. Yet. But remember -- all batteries degrade with time.\n\nAfter having used it... my thoughts\n- Takes a bit to charge up, once discharged (so once you've discharged, plan ahead). Especially the first time.\n\n- However, once it's charged up, the self-discharge rate is slow, so you don't have to constantly keep it plugged into a wall wart, etc. You can charge this up, once conditioned, and pack it away for a few weeks to a few months.\n\n- The 4 LED meters on the front are handy for determining SoC / Time to Charge\n\n- Form factor on this is very similar to the dimensions on my S8 (although a little thicker, and of course, heavier)\n\n- A shorter USB A <> USB-C cable does double duty -- USB A to bring the charge to the phone / device via USB-C, then remove & flip USB-C into the input of the Anker, while plugging the 'A' end into any compatible port to recharge it.\n\n- Comes with a black cloth bag with drawstring closure, which is nice to keep that short USB cable together with the device. Nothing fancy, but useful.\n\n- And probably the best, after using Qi-Wireless for 90% of the time over the life of the G8 -- this thing puts juice into the phone, quickly. I can go from 5-15% charge to 30% in under 30min. Not sure how many amps it's charging at (rated at 'up to 12' -?), but it's definitely quick. If you're caught somewhere without power (or even if you're not) -- this device is a lifesaver (figuratively & perhaps literally, I guess).\n\nTechnically, I guess you're not supposed to use the phone while charging with a power bank, but it comes in handy for those times where you need to use the phone a little longer, but need a little juice to tide you over (it juices the phone so fast--especially vs. Qi-wireless--that you say \"I might as well just keep it hooked up to this)). I think it'll charge close to 100% in about 90 minutes, maybe less.\n\n- Since my G8 battery is ~ 3800 mAh (?), I can get up to two full charges out of this thing, or many 'partial' charges. From full, 30 minutes' time on the G8 doesn't even remove one 'dot' from the 4-light meter. This is real value, in my book. Because most of the time, I can get back to a power source in 30min or so.\n\nSo... for what I'm using it for, which is to buy time until I decide to finally (!) upgrade my phone, and keep the S8 running a little while longer... it's an excellent accessory, from a trusted company. Since this has been out a while, and been superseded by higher-cap devices, solar-capable chargers, etc. -- it's also cheap -- about the cost of one of those replacement battery kits (with batteries that came from who knows where).\n\nNot often I unequivocally give the full 5-stars... but this product gets them from me. Recommended.\n(oh, and mine came new in a box, so if yours doesn't... get in touch with Anker for a new replacement)",

        "content": "Yet another quality mobile phone battery charger from Anker. It works great, no issues, it can charge my Pixel 6 Pro from ~low~ to full and still have charge to spare.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this battery is the size. The old versions of Anker's 10000mAH batteries were shorter and thicker. They have changed this batter to be thinner but longer. Its almost as large as my Pixel 6 Pro, which itself is a 6.7\" phone. This battery is HUGE compared to the old models. I am sure its related to the internals they are using. But the issue this creates is realted to \"pocketability\". This thing is so large that I cannot really fit it in my pocket easily with my phone that its charging, and its so long that it sticks out of my smaller rear-pockets. The only comfortable way I have found to use this charger is to keep it in the rear pocket of my backpack and use a longer USB-C cord to charge my phone in my pocket.\n\nWith previous batteries this was never a problem, I could fit both the battery + my phone in the same pocket, not so much with this model. Maybe your mileage will vary if you have more pockets or bigger pockets or smaller phones.\n\nIts not a deal breaker but it does mean that if I want to take this charger with me, I generally need to also bring along a bag of some sort.",

        "content": "Celestron travel scope is a good product for what it is made for. It is primarily a terrestrial viewing scope. The objective (large lens in front of the scope) is good quality and is functional. However, the eyepieces that come with the scope are (in my opinion) lower quality (this is probably done to keep the total cost of the scope low). Without a decent eyepiece the experience of viewing objects will be minimal.\nWhat I did was invest about $25.00 (they can be higher priced - based on quality) in a good quality 20mm x1.25 inch (a good standard starting size) \"Plossel\" type eyepiece (several listed on Amazon for under $30.00). The addition of a higher quality eyepiece really changed the viewing experience with this scope. Or, if you want to get into astronomical viewing with this scope Celestron makes an Observers Accessory Kit (#94308- you can get it on Amazon - about $70.00). It comes with two Plossel eyepieces -17mm and 6mm-, a moon filter (definitely will need it to bring down the glare if observing the moon), a 2X Barlow lens (doubles the magnification of the eyepieces), and two planetary filters, and a case. It seems like a well put together and thought out accessory kit (I know, another $70.00 !!).\nAlso (as stated in other reviews) the tripod is weak (when extended to its full length). What I recommend is getting a sturdy table (and chair) and set the tripod (in its non-extended or shortest length) on the table. Sit in the chair, and rotate the 45 degree prism (with eyepiece attached) until you can see what you want. You don't need to be standing to view the stars (or whatever)!! It is even better to get a 90 degree correct image diagonal to view the heavens with (that way you don't have to bend over so far, and you can aim the scope higher - I know even more money - actually about $45.00 for a starter correct image diagonal). Become familiar with how the pieces attach (eyepiece to 45 degree prism to insertion in the telescopes focusing tube-and how they can be rotated to your seated position) and you will get a lot more enjoyment out of this well made product.\nRemember, this is not a heavy duty alt-azimuth tripod with slow motion controls (Celestron #93607 - which looks like it would fit this scopes screw on base). It is basically a standard camera tripod. You will have to \"play\" with it and figure out (especially on celestial objects) how to aim it high and then tighten the adjustments (which will lower the object into your field of view). You could even buy a heavier tripod with the same type of adjustments that this tripod has - Celestron #93610- it would make the scope more secure if you needed to fully extend the legs on the tripod - I have one that I use with some of my other telescopes - you just have to get used to the way it adjusts -think each mentioned tripod is about $80.00 to $90.00 (that money just keeps adding up !!). The adjustment for lowering the object into view while tightening the tripod controls takes some getting used to, but it can be learned -and is part of the overall \"experience\" of this fine travel scope.\nAlso, about the adjustments on the tripod. The vertical (up and down) lever on the tripod - do not back it out all the way. What happened to me is that a small nut that attaches the handle to the tripod will fall out. So what I did was put a piece of tape over the hole where the nut is - so if I backed out the adjustment to far, the nut would not fall out (no big deal - just need to be aware that it could happen).\nI have had this scope for several years, and have seen many celestial objects with it (although I use a correct image 90 degree star diagonal - as stated previously). It is a nice scope for its intended purpose, however (in my opinion) it does need a couple of upgrades (as suggested).\nFurther, if you need to make the tripod more secure when it is on a table top or partially extended - try draping some \"strap on ankle weights\" over one or more of the tripod's braces (let one or both sides of the weight rest on the table - so you don't over stress the brace). I had some old strap on ankle weights lying around, just draped one over the brace (without strapping it down), and it makes it much more secure. Also, you get two ankle braces in a set. So you will have an extra one if you need it !!\nSo let's review. The most important item on any telescope is the objective lens (as stated previously) the large lens in the front of the scope. The Celestron Travel scope objective lens is of good quality, that's where I think the product excels. I recommend to buy a higher quality eyepiece (Plossel type), add some weight to the tripod (as suggested)-do not extend the tripod into its fully extended position (becomes really shaky and weak)-keep it as \"low as possible\"-preferably on a table top (add an \"ankle weight\" to the fold out extensions), learn how to rotate the 45 degree diagonal so you can view while seated (this won't change the correct image view of the object), and you have a very well made, fairly light weight travel scope. I have used this scope for terrestrial and astronomical purposes, and as a \"spotting scope\" while at the range. Works perfectly !! I hope this review has assisted you in your decision (I know -I didn't intend for this review to be so long - but there you have it !!). Have fun !!",

        "content": "A decent starter telescope, but, as others have said, the tripod is a piece of junk, and the spotter scope is diffiult to use. We went up to Joshua Tree Nat'l Park to see the \"new\" comet and even with the tripod on the hood of the car, using the telescope required crouching almost onto one's knees. Very wobbly and hard to keep trained, esp. when one's fingers are freezing cold! Also, the fasteners for the tripod legs almost guarantee that you'll pinch your finger at least once every time you extend a leg. To use the telescope at all, even if you have a low chair it'll crick your back. Sadly, I'm betting many beginners will become so frustrated they'll give up and return the whole thing. Get a decent tripod, one you can stand up to use, or even sit comfortably in a normal camp chair. The telescope DOES give a good look at stars/planets however. The instructions should also tell you which of the eye pieces you should use, depending on what you're looking at. As it is, this may be best used for peering into neighbors' windows. No, don't be a creeper. Don't do that.",

        "content": "TL;DR Review: Great portable scope. Get a separate tripod - tripod wobbles.\n\nDefinitely recommended for anyone who would like to take a scope with them on a trip, for someone who doesn't have the space for a permanently mounted scope, for a student whose interested in astronomy, or as a fun add-on to keep in the trunk on trips to anywhere. It’s small, lightweight, and priced right. It’s light enough that a five-year old could carry it for an entire trip without effort, giving them direct participation in the setup process.\n\nThis is an amazing little telescope which you can easily take anywhere you're going. Looking at the moon, you'll be able to see the moon in fantastic detail, clearly seeing the ridges of the craters peaking above the moon's northern pole. Aimed at any patch of the sky, stars will become visible when before you saw nothing but darkness.\n\nAs with all telescopes with this magnification, you will not see the individual rings of Saturn, but you will be able to make out the halo of the rings. Jupiter's moons, though, will be easy to spot, but speaking of spots, you won't see Jupiter's red-spot. Mars and Venus are indistinctive.\n\nAs for galaxies, if you know where to look, Andromeda can be seen. As for using this scope for daytime viewing of birds and bees, it's perfect.\n\nMy recommendation is to pair this scope with a Gosky Cell Phone Adapter Mount (you can order one here on Amazon - see my review for photos and videos take with it) and use your phone's camera to capture some amazing shots. Note positioning the Gosky is tricky, so prepared to be frustrated as you try to get the phone's camera and the telescope aligned. It’s not a defect and it's not something you're doing wrong - it's just worth it, but difficult. And if you want to get photos of objects you can't even see through the telescope with your phone, Google \"android [or iphone] astronomy photo stacking\", \"NightCap Pro,\" or \"iastrophotography\".\n\nWhat makes this scope a winner it how easy it is to carry around. The included backpack has enough extra space that you can easily toss a laptop or Chromebook in it - I have.\n\nIt also comes with two high-quality eyepieces (20mm and 10mm) which allow you toquickly switch them up as needed.\n\nEach lens also comes with a cap (a needed feature), though I wouldn't fret too much if I lost one. The side finderscope is well aligned and will make targeting much simpler.\n\nBut the tripod! The tripod! It's OK, but because it's tiny and lightweight, it's not stiff and suffers from touch-wobble. You'll repeatedly find yourself aiming for an object and then when you let go of the telescope or tripod, sometimes it will move out of alignment. You just need to be cognizant of this and use a light touch once you've locked it down to where you want to aim.\n\nSince I’ve gotten it, my son and I have used it in City locations and in the country – obviously it works great in both locations.\n\nSo if the tripod is poor - why did you give it 5 stars instead of 4? For the size, price, and weight of the tripod, it’s what you would expect. A sturdier tripod will weigh a whole lot more and will be bigger, killing the portability aspects of what without the tripod would automatically make this a 5-star telescope. So it’s neither the tripod’s fault nor the Celestron’s. A better-built tripod would weigh more and cost a lot more.\n\nAs a person who doesn’t read manuals, do read the instruction manual. Some parts aren’t obvious. I managed to figure out how to put it together but would have had a much easier time if I had taken two minutes to flip through the instruction manual.",

        "content": "I don't know why people are expecting the results of the Hubble Telescope in the reviews. It does exactly what it's designed to do. It takes the moon and makes it look like a large marble that's placed a few inches from your eye that's in pretty good focus. You can see some craters on the Moon, but you can't see Niel Armstrong's footprints. You can see the rings of Saturn, but you can't count them like a tree that's been cut in half. I'm not sure why some individuals have ridiculous expectations for something that's less than $100...\n\nThere are better scopes out there, sure, but it's a great beginner scope for kids and amateurs. I got this for my 7 year old who has shown interest in the Cosmos. If he really gets into it, I'll invest more later and pass this to his younger siblings. For right now, it's perfect.\n\nThe frame is light, but the scope is light and doesn't need a heavy duty frame. It holds the scope, which is what it's designed to do.\n\nAll the pieces were accounted for, and it came with a backpack so it can be taken on trips so you don't need to buy a separate case to hold it when you're traveling in the car or walking somewhere.\n\nIt does what it was designed to do. Great for kids and amateurs at a modest price to see nature, take it to a long distance shooting range, see space a bit better, and anything else that is legal to do. If you want to see a nebula, and have a few thousand dollars to spare, go for it and buy that kind of scope.\n\nFor the normal people with real expectations, this is a great telescope for beginners and kids. Well worth the investment if you're unsure if you want to invest a large amount of money to see footprints on the Moon.\n\nTake care!",

        "content": "For background I've never owned a telescope and haven't done much astronomy since high school.\n\nI bought this as a gift for our bright 5.5 year old daughter, knowing she may need to grow into it a bit. Before settling on this particular model, I considered paying several times more for a good T-scope the whole family could use for years to come. However, after reading more about beginner scopes, I agreed that a more complicated or powerful scope could discourage her. Further, although she thinks astronomy is pretty neat today and she can name all the planets (including a few dwarfs), there's a chance her interest wanes. In that case, I'm only out $100.\n\nIt took me about 30 minutes to skim through the instructions and assemble the scope. Adjusting the finderscope was a little more difficult, however. I found myself wishing it had some simple calibration screws that would move the crosshairs left/right and up/down. Instead, the finder scope is held in place by inserting it into a broad ring with three inward facing screws. It was a bit of an effort to get this calibrated (still not 100%) and I can tell it would easily be thrown off if bumped or if I pack and unpack the scope. Basically, you don't want to touch it after calibration (and try to get a 5 year old to not touch something interesting like that).\n\nI'd read reviews saying the tripod may be flimsy, but I wasn't concerned given we have two others for our cameras. Nevertheless, it seems to work and I left one segment on each leg unextended so our daughter could reach the viewfinder. I found Jupiter w/o much of a problem, but because the scope is front-heavy, it required a few iterations of sighting, loosening-moving-then tightening the panhandle, and sighting again before I got accustomed to the scope \"dipping\" after I'd locked things in. Perhaps there is a technique that makes this easier, but I believe some scopes have counterweights to manage this. Perhaps a sturdier tripod would help.\n\nThat said, these are all things I can deal with and weren't entirely unexpected. I was impressed that not only could we see Jupiter but also its four largest moons. I initially thought they might be a lens flare or a defect, but after looking at on line photos I confirmed it's the real deal, which was pretty exciting. Worth noting that a little kid will have a harder time closing one eye and steadily looking into an eyepiece to see something as small as a planet. I'm hopeful the moon is easier for her. Mom has already joked that Dad has a new telescope.",

        "content": "I've never liked adding a liner behind a shower curtain, with their swimming pool plastics and poor light filtration. Also, almost all shower curtains in stores are for a full size shower with a tub, and I have a shower stall (no tub), so they are far too big.\n\nThis company offered liner-free products in more sizes than I had ever seen, which enabled me to find one in a size that fit my needs better than the \"one size fits all\" items available in stores.\n\nThe fabric has a nice feel, and is opaque enough to not make the shower too dark, while still providing privacy (good for those with low light showers). Magnets at the bottom add some weight, though not quite enough for my household, apparently: a forceful / errant shower spray can push the bottom of the curtain out of the stall, resulting in water on the bathroom floor (parents of children are forewarned *chuckles*).\n\nThe product is also machine washable, not overly stiff, and made of a material with no outgassing. Needless to say, I am overall very pleased with it.\n\nPros:\n• A wide variety of widths (including several different lengths)\n• Pleasant, natural fabric feel\n• No outgassing like plastic liners\n• Machine washable\n• Good light filtration while still allowing privacy\n\nCons:\n• Could be a bit better weighted at the bottom",

        "content": "I actually got this for reading in bed, lol. My husband has to leave for work early but I like to read into the wee hours. I hadn't liked any of the book lights I had before, and I thought I would try this, since it goes around my neck as opposed to being clipped to the book. It's not heavy on my neck at all. Other features I like:\n\n1. It has 3 brightness levels, so you can choose what you need based on your eyes and/or surroundings.\n\n2. it also has 3 different light settings, warm, cool, and daylight. The warm is really very yellow so although I prefer warm light, in this case I don't. But since I have other options to choose from, and I really like those, I'm fine with that.\n\n3. It's FLEXIBLE! This is probably one of my favorite features. I can adjust the position of the lights based on where I'm holding my book, or to make sure that it's shining away from hubby. Both sides are separately movable, so the light on the side where hubby is sleeping, I tend to flex further inward so that the pool of light is away from him. The \"arms\" can also be flexed up or down, so really, you can adjust this to whatever feels best for you.\n\n4. I also like that because this goes around my neck, it has so many more options than being just a book light, although that's why I bought it. I've used it for tasks around the house, walking my dog at night, and other things I hadn't really thought of until I had the product in hand.\n\n5. It's rechargeable, with an included cord. I have yet to recharge it, and I've used it often but not for really long periods of time in one stretch, so I'd say for now that one charge seems to last a decent amount of time. It has lights on the back that indicate whether it's charged or not, so far, mine is still fully charged, if the # of lights is any indication.\n\nI'm really very happy with this and actually look forward to tucking into bed with this; previous reading attempts involved covering the lampshade so hubby could sleep, and then it would be too dim for me to actually see, or if I adjusted the cover, then it was too bright for him. This really allows me to adjust it to whatever position and brightness works for both of us. This would also be great for plane/bus trips where the lights are off if you still want to read an actual book (as opposed to an e-reader with light).",

        "content": "This item is powered by USB and is simple, quick and long lasting . The design is practical and very flexible to adjust it to your needs.\nI love to read or do crossword puzzles at night in bed. I am always falling asleep with every light object glowing for hours. My husband had a hard time falling asleep with a power grid blazing in our bedroom which is not hard to understand. I had to seek a more equitable way to solve this dilemma.\nMy solution: put the TV on a timer which is usually available in your settings menu and then put on the CC so lower volume would work. Even without this master plan, I find this necklight a great find for toning down the glare of other light sources while reading/working in bed or chair!!!\nTHEN take this lightweight neck light and pick a mode: reg,cool or warm. The ends of the light beautifully illuminates an area that does not distract anyone else( unless you shine it into their face) and you can fall asleep knowing that not only that you are not bothering anyone but you could simply shut it off in the morning .\nPlug it into where you charged your phone in during the night and way before nightfall this wonderful device would be ready for use without the need of batteries.\nI have taken it on a three day mini vacation and forgot a charger for it and it was perfectly fine! I love it!!!! It is very lightweight and not the least bit uncomfortable. I love it!!! Great for a gift for night owls or those elderly with a roomate.....Have I mentioned that I love it ?????",

        "content": "For starters - this is a great light. It is lightweight, quiet to turn on/adjust, and targets fairly well to my crochet work or other items close by that I want to focus on in low light or dark rooms.\n\nI got the new/upgraded model, in Grey (IE: New Grey) and so far have been able to use my high powered USB-c phone charger and cable to charge it, I did not need to use the cable that shipped with it. This is helpful as I have a 10ft USB-C to USB-C high-speed cable with a 45W USB-C wall charger parked on my end table and by my bedside for fast charging my electronics and can charge this light with the same setup. I saw many reviews about the original / non-upgraded version (the listings without 'new' in front of the color) being a bit more picky about the cable and charger strength/power and may have needed their specific cable and a lower powered wall charger, so this was important to me.\n\nI had been very thrilled by the news that I could turn on only one light instead of both - reiterated several times in Q&A etc that this was true for the 'new'/upgraded version too. Unfortunately, even when asking specifically about the 'new' or 'upgraded' version, answers seemed to be that YES one light could be used. No info on how to make that happen though and I cannot find a way to do so. If you know - please please comment on this review with 'how'.\n\nOn the old version (look at the product listing/pictures) - there was a power/brightness click-through button on each arm that operated that one light only and the 'color' or 'warmth' of light was on the back of the neckband.\nOn the new/upgraded version (IE: \"New Grey\" vs the old model as just \"Gray\" or 'New Pink' vs 'Pink'), one arm has a on/off button, the other arm has 2 buttons, one for color/warmth and one for the three brightness settings. The power resumes color and brightness from last use and turns on both lights. The brightness button adjusts both lights. Not what was pictured in reviews about using one light.\n\nIf there is a way to operate each light separately, I'd love to hear HOW. Not just that it can be done. I've posted the question a couple of ways in Customer Q&A to no avail.",

However THIS IS THE ONE! My main concerns were 1) It wouldn't hold enough juice to actually power anything or only enough to give a little charge and then die on me when I really needed it. Neither of the above are an issue. It definitely hold enough juice and not only does it hold as much juice as it says in the description, but it charges sooooo fast! My phone (Galaxy) went from 11% to 100% in less than 45 mins and I still had enough to charge it 2 more times before having to plug in the battery pack again. The price was unbeatable, and the quality is more than worth the price. And it comes with 2!!! If you need a good quality battery pack this one is definitely it.

I've carefully used it without the guard following the instructions to have the item on a flat, even hard surface & the results were perfect and no damage to the sweater. I'm still on my first set of 2 batteries and I'm surprised how long they have lasted considering how long I've fun the device.\n\nThe ONLY caveat is that the lint shavings get stuck up at the head of the device. I have to tap it for the shavings to go down into the \"Fluff Collector\" receptacle & have found it needs to be brushed out from the top, blown thru or vacuumed in order to full clean the top section sometimes more than once on a bigger sweater. So this requires a bit more work than I expected. I think it's a great tool for the price. The results are fantastic. The shape is great for it's purpose but not as much for cleaning it. I would give it 4.5 stars if it let me instead of 4.",

Unfortunately my skin reacted to that band (Apple confirmed there is nickel in the snap).\n\nAnyway, the folks that engineered this band got around that issue by simple ensuring the snap has no skin contact - it’s covered by silicone on the back. Genius! The material is comfortable, close to the Apple brand in feel and design. The closure has an extra loop so it feels even more secure. I have taken these swimming in the pool and ocean and so far they’re holding up and still look and feel nice.\n\nMy only complaint is that the components that fasten the bands to the watch are a bit inconsistent - some wiggle a bit when installed but others don’t. So far they all seem secure.\n\nOverall, you can’t beat these bands for the price. They’re an improvement over the expensive name brand bands in many ways, especially for those with severe nickel sensitivities. If you’re on the fence, give these a shot.",

After scouring the internet for a smaller band, I gave up and purchased these in BOTH sizes so that I could try BOTH on with the intention of returning one set.\n\nUltimately, YES - the 38/40/41 size band FITS a 45mm watch. There is a small gap on either side of the watch face/casing; however, this does NOT impact the wear, use, or functionality. I have been wearing the smaller band on my 45mm watch for 10+ days now and it hasn't budged - even with physical activity. The band remains securely locked in place to the watch. I will be keeping the 38/40/41 set for my 45mm watch.\n\nThe 42/44/45/49 size of course still fit my 45mm watch. These larger bands actually have MORE holes than the Apple band that came with the watch. I was able to secure it around my wrist - however, the \"tail\" on the band was REALLY long. Even with it tucked inside the band (how it's supposed to be worn), the tail still hit the actual watch casing and was not comfortable for me to wear. If I had to keep the 42/44/45/49 set, I would have ended up trimming the tails off.\n\nI kept the 38/40/41 size set of bands and returned the 42/44/45/49 size bands. I have an Apple Watch Series 8 GPS + Cellular 45mm and am a female with SMALL wrists.",

They are so comfortable compared to the bands you get with an Apple Watch, they aren’t so stiff and they don’t cut into my wrist bone like others tend to (I have very tiny skinny/bony wrist). They fit great and can mix and match colors for different holidays! Will definitely be ordering more in the near future!",

I only wanted black - prefer simplicity and not changing straps but they’re value for money as one strap would cost 💲6+. All colors in the set I chose are beautiful and I love them all. Best part is how easily the straps slide into (and out of)the face of watch, perfect width on sliding sides, and the velvety smooth texture. I’m so thankful for this product and I’m so happy I constantly admire my khaki green strap while at work today LOL. Thank you seller and amazon!",

        "content": "July 8, 2022 - I admit i have stopped swapping them and when only charging via one part i stopped swapping ports (I wanted to test both of these and all four ports for review purposes due to all the \"these are junk and caught fire\" type of reviews) ... I think OVERALL i felt these get warm ...3 times maybe ... and on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being \"oh crap, this is a fire harzard and i need something to grab onto this before my room burns up\") .... i think MAYBE i'd say a .50 out of 10 ... slighltly warm and within a minute of two of being unplugged it was not noticable and i USE THESE REGULARLY with different cords and devices ... almost daily with something i need to charge and NO PROBLEMS at all. I do have to mention those three times max was AT LEAST when the charger was plugged in 2+ hours and even with the same cord and device, and outlet and plugged into the same \"port\" ... it doesn't happen again for months ... so it's not like one bad cable or wall outlet is causing that RARE (.50 out of 10) \"heating\" issue ... IF i had any doubts i'd say it and not recommend these ... I forgot when i bought these but it's been months and I am still happy with these and not even questioning if they are safe\n\nFeb 2022 Update: I fully admit i forgot when i orginally bought it and also i only may have swapped them ONCE since the last update ... still NOT getting burning hot like some reviews mention... still charging a-ok ... I may swap the ones I use regularly after typing this just as a test but just wanted to say months later and as someone who was concerned over the bad reviews ... everything is peachy here .. no problems at all and I do charge things at LEAST somewhat regularly\n\nUpdate from Mid October: Swaping both of them just to see if there are any issues and everything is still a-ok.... the one point I want to make in this update is that I have said i have swapped ports and cables and devices, just to test things out ... I KNOW these are not \"fast chargers\" but I have charged things in both adapters with things plugged into each side and ... while I do have another OLD dual usb port wall charger (I got these as a backup, as so many things I own now need to be charged this way) ... the speed of which both items charge seem normal to me ... as advertised for those products and no issues afterwards.\n\nThe fire warnings from some negative reviews still worries me and just in case I only use them when i am right next to where they are so i could test (for heat) and/or yank them out fast ... but so far ... no issues or SIGNS Of issues of any kind\n\nUpdate: Week 1 of October and I do use these regularly ... DUE TO the negative reviews I have been doing my best to switch cables (even if dont need to ... like different micro usb cables, different usb c cables ....etc) and even though i admit i have been forgetting (I charge thing REGULARLY) ... doing my best, to remember to switch not only chargers between the two ... but ports .... so far ... i think i have said this in my original review ... is not related to the cable or device specifically .. SOMETIMES (rare ... say 1 out of every .. oh 20 charges ... i am sort of making that up i admit) i feel a slight warmed to the charger only when it's plugged into the wall outlet.... say on a scale 1 to 10 ... 10 being \"this is going to cause a fire\"/\"so hot i cant touch it\" ... now I'd say ... a .25 maybe out of 10 ... barely a 1 .. .noticable when i do feel that but ... i cant say any other charger I have had, doesn't have the same thing happen.\n\ni am concerned about any fire danger due to the reviews from others but ... so far my two .... have been A-OK for a few months now.\n\nAlso some 1 out of 5 reviews complain this is not a \"fast\" charger.... I KNEW THAT when I bought them. f you need a fast charger .... they are always more $$ then what looks the same but is a regular charger ... IF THAT Is what you need ... look for something like \"supports QUalcomm fast charge technology\" or something ... just \"this chargers fast\" in the general discription may be common even if its a regular charger (say 2-3 hours for devices on a regular charger but a fast charger could do it on 45minutes to 1 hour) ...some of the 1 out of 5 star reviews may have come from people that just didn't read what this charger could do .....\n\nUpdate: It's now in the first week or so of September ... I admit I stopped (maybe i should start up again) switching between the two adapters and between each plug on each adapter as much as I was doing a few weeks back ... I am not sure i'd trust this (ONLY based on the bad reviews alone) leave this plugged in when I am not right next to them to yank them from the wall if there was an issue but ... STILL TO THIS DAY ... and many things being charged ... no problems at all and I cant remember what I was charging when the adapter got a little (say maybe ... oh a 1 ... 1.5 maybe out of 10 ... 10 \"being a problem\" .... but I have NOT noticed either adapter even getting slightly warm to any degree since then ... everything is a-ok so far\n\n(Another Update ... less than 30 days ... though i forgot when i posted the update below) ... I am going back and forth between the two items and TRYING to remember to use both ports on each one ... so far NO funny sounds, i guess at times i'd say they'd get SLIGHLY warm when plugged into the wall (say a 1 out of 10 MAX .. enough to notice but BARELY enough to mention ... I JUST MENTION IT @ the reviews that say how hot theirs are .... and to be fair I dont mess with \"possible fires\" ... if i dont 100% trust these I will not use them again) .... SO FAR ... everything is a-ok and I do use them ALOT\n-----\nUpdate (still less than 30 days from purchase but with many different devices charged via usb c or micro-usb cable) SO far ... admitting some negative reviews say issues come up in say month 2 or a little after that ... everything is a-ok ... To address the \"heat\" problem i was worried about reading some reviews ... WHEN PLUGGED IN only ... on a scale from 1 to 10 ... 10 being \"too hot to touch\" ... the honest i have felt it got ... (and only SOMETIMES) would be when it was plugged in for awhile and it would be a ... 1.5 to a 2 MAX ... if that ... i leave it unplugged (due to those negative reviews and \"mine caught fire\") when i am not around if something bad happens... but ... having said that ... I dont worry too much about that when i am in the house .... these dont feel like the cheapest plastics made and probably POOR electronics on the inside .... I trust them or i'd never plug my stuff into them ... I just dont want to take a change, is all.\n\nI'd recommend them so far even if i wish they'd offer say a 1pk for $4.50 or something (just got these as a backup to my one wall charger I 've had since 2013, that is still working great)\n\n-----------\nI have to preference that these are first impressions and while I have not checked the 4th port ... I have charged a few different devices already and tested both plugs and 3 out of the 4 total usb ports.\n\nI am not going to open them up but they dont feel super cheap or anything ... smaller than my old white PowerGen 2.1A White charger from about 2013 (still have it and it works fine all these years later ... i just got these for a backup).\n\nI am not going to say the are \"SUPER high quality\" or go overboard in anyway like that but the prongs seem normal and unlike some reviews I read in no way do they feel like they bend easy or fall out of outlets. I do know that some reviews mention things being fine for awhile and THEN issues start, but so far I have not seen or felt anything fishy. I DO NOT take chances with electricity being involved but with the few things I have charged .. neither adapter feels hot in any way (maybe say a .5 out of 10, when plugged in for awhile, but that is charging two devices and i say that is normal) ... also I do not hear any noise of any kind coming from the charger.\n\nI will be SURE to update this review either way, as time goes on, but fearing a really cheap product and not wanting to mix that with electricity of course, so far ... I am pretty happy with my purchase ... I probably only needed one since my old charger still works, but ah well",

    "description": "From the manufacturer\nA Great Way to Enjoy Popcorn\n\nThe Micro-Pop microwave popcorn popper puts you back in control by offering a healthy way to make popcorn. Bagged popcorn is filled with harmful chemicals that can negatively affect you and your family. The Micro-Pop features a temperature safe borosilicate glass bowl that is safe to use. Just place your kernels in the bowl and microwave for a couple minutes for fresh, delicious popcorn.\n\nSave Time, Money and the Landfill\n\nGone are the days of buying bagged popcorn with artificial flavors and colors. Save time by making less trips to the grocery store and save money by buying popcorn kernels in the jar vs. the pre-packaged popcorn. Using the Micro-Pop also helps our landfills by eliminating the wax-coated disposable bags from pre-bagged popcorn that can take a long time to decompose.\n\nEasy to Clean\n\nThe Micro-Pop popcorn maker, lid and borosilicate glass bowl are dishwasher safe for fast and easy clean-up.\n\nHow to Make a Delicious Bowl of Popcorn Using the Micro-Pop Popcorn Popper\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThe lid serves as a convenient measuring tool for your kernels. For the 1.5 quart Micro-Pop, use one lid full of kernels for a bowl of popcorn. For the 3 quart Micro-Pops, use 2 lids full of kernels. You can also add less kernels to the bowl if you wish to enjoy a smaller amount of popcorn.\n\n\t\n\nDrop the measured kernels into the bottom of the popper and place the lid on top to go in the microwave.\n\n\t\n\nThis step is entirely optional, but the perforated lid can be used to melt butter or margarine over your popcorn while it pops. The lid allows to butter to melt through the holes and distribute evenly over the kernels.\n\n\t\n\nPlease note that microwaves vary greatly. Make sure you are listening to the pops while your microwave is making the popcorn and stop the microwave once the pops get to be 2 seconds apart. Some microwaves may require more time, while others require less time.\n\nA fast and easy way to make microwave popcorn.\n\nTips to getting your popcorn just right:\n\nNot all microwaves work exactly the same, so play with the timing until you get it just right. Experiment a little- your microwave may cook the popcorn faster or slower than the 2:30-3:00 average! If your precious popcorn is getting burnt when adding butter prior to popping, try adding the butter after all those kernels have transformed into beautiful puffed popcorn.\nAlways use fresh popcorn kernels. Store your popcorn in an airtight container. Refrigeration is not recommended.\nStopping and starting your microwave during the cooking cycle is not recommended. Once you stop the microwave, the steam buildup in the center of the kernel, which causes the popcorn to pop, will cool off and never reach the desired temperature to re-pop. If you restart the microwave you also risk burning the already popped popcorn. Using the sound test is the best way to determine if your popcorn is done. If there are more than two full seconds between pops, it’s time to stop.",

        "content": "When popping a half popper full (one cap full of corn), the kernels have plenty of room to bounce around and open up as they pop. When popping a full popper full (two caps full of corn) about half way through the popping cycle the popper is full and the remaining kernels can't move around so they don't expand fully. I found them packed so tightly in the popper that I had to dig them out with a long-handled spoon.\n\nIn addition, popcorn popped in a microwave with no oil is so dry that flavored salt will not stick to it. You will find all of your flavoring in the bottom of your bowl. I suppose you could lightly spray the popped corn with cooking oil spray and then add the salt. I truly haven't tried that. I have added real butter to the measuring cup on the popper and that works very well but not great for my weight.\n\nAs fast as this popper pops corn, I don't see that popping 2 half batches is really much of a downside. It is very easy to clean since both parts just drop into the dishwasher. That's why I give it a 4 out of 5.",

However, after a few years our microwave broke and the new one I replaced it with was too small to fit the popper inside it. Anyway, fast-forward a few years later and I really missed eating popcorn as a light snack so I decided to purchase the smaller version of the other and I'm happy to report it works just as well as the larger one. I don't know how popcorn is this easy but it just seems to work. I know there are some other microwavable poppers available but I think the handle really makes this one worth it.",

If you are like me and have several USB-C devices and various cables with different capabilities (especially when it comes to charging devices), but still have a few USB-A ports to spare, this adapter does a couple really nice things:\n\n1) It adapts your old ports to USB-C without losing any of their original functionality. This is nice for car ports and older machines that haven't moved entirely to USB-C. You can convert entirely to USB-C-to-whatever cables without having to worry about not being able to charge your phone when you're out in the world.\n\n2) it actually expands charging capabilities for certain setups. I have some USB-C-to-USB-C or lightning cables that provide TOO MUCH power for certain devices. They just need 5 or 10w charging, but not every dock or device is smart enough to throttle power and leave you unable to charge your Airpods Pros unless you can find a low power port. Now I just keep one of these on a cable that's dedicated for low power charging.",

        "content": "It's always so exciting to get a new phone, but the headache comes when you realize you need a case and a screen protector and a camera lens protector and it's all just kinda overwhelming. Not only because options are usually somewhat slim, but also because there aren't ever that many reviews yet! So how are we supposed to know if it's a good product? Well, I guess we just have to cross our fingers and hope for the best. Which is what I did with this purchase. At the time of my order, there were 12 reviews, all 5 stars and they seemed really legitimate. This seemed like a better option than going with another brand that just keeps the same reviews from last year's item and changes the title to this year's model. With that said, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Actually, I could, but it's something super minor and I'll get into that later. For now, I want to mention all of the great things I've noticed about these screen and lens protectors. First, I love how even though the top looks like it's cut out for the camera, it's actually not on the finished product. It's a smooth covering that's fully protected. It's just that those areas don't have the 'privacy' glass like the rest of it does. It's a nice fit for the iPhone 14, although I do think it is just a hair too small. With a case, it doesn't bother me though, as the gap between the case and the edge of the protector is minimal and I can't really feel it unless I'm trying to. The lens protector was a huge surprise to me. I didn't think I'd really care if it were there or not, but now I'm absolutely thrilled to have it! I always had such a hard time keeping my lenses clean and free of nicks and dents around them, but now I don't have to worry about that at all. It's a flat surface all the way across, so a quick wipe with whatever cloth is nearby means my photos will be clear. It also feels really nice to the touch versus having to deal with those clunky ugly lenses. It's definitely something I didn't know I needed in my life and I'm so glad it was included in this kit! I suppose it would be nice if there were color options for the black rings, but that's a petty ask and it doesn't really matter. The fact that the kit comes with 3 of everything is such a huge bonus. The glass feels durable and not too bendy. I'm also noticing way less fingerprints and smudges on my screen than usual! It's smooth and feels really natural to use.\n\nThe one and only real thing I would change is the overall 'privacy' aspect of it. While I don't really have anything to hide, I always hate that feeling of someone seeing what I'm up to on my own phone. This protector does what it needs to, but I could use a tad more privacy. Even at a 45 degree angle, it's still possible to see what's on the screen, it just makes it a little blurry. At an almost 90 degree angle, it's fully blurry, but you can still make out shapes and colors. The only true way to hide your screen from curious eyes is to turn the brightness down as low as you can handle it.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the customer service. Upon purchasing, I received a message from the seller to make sure I ordered the right item for the iPhone I have. I had, so there was no issue, but they also included some useful tips on how to install the protectors and offered assistance should I need it. In my entire existence as an Amazon customer, I have never received any message like that from any other seller. It really made me feel like they care about their product and their users. It was such a lovely touch and I wish more companies/sellers would do the same.",

Since this phone is expensive, I decided to look into getting some quality protection to keep it safe from unexpected accidents.\n\nFinding a protective screen that’s also built for privacy has been HARD. All of the stores were sold out, and I honestly didn’t want to spend $30 on a Belkin one. Nothing on Belkin; their products are really great quality. Just couldn’t justify it in my mind when I knew there were equally great and more affordable options.\n\nWhich brings me to my review: these are a PERFECT option for someone who wants a privacy screen that’s affordable, easy to install, actually works, and is easy to see through.\n\nIt comes with extra screens for the phone and cameras, plus everything you need to install them 😩🙌🏽 AND at a fraction of the cost of a Belkin one that only comes with 1?! A steal.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether you should buy or not. Def just buy it — totally worth the expense imo.",

I couldn't fine one for iPhone 14 though from the other company, so I figured I'd try this one after reading a lot of reviews. Secondly, all three camera lens covers all came off within less than 24hrs of putting each one on, and wouldn't stick again. I didn't ask for a refund because I still used the privacy screen protector though, and I ended up just ordering camera lens covers from a different company on Amazon which have stayed on since day one of using them. However, after less than a month of having this phone it somehow managed to fall and hit a large screw that happened to be sticking straight out of the ground. I picked it up and saw a chunk dug into the protector and cracks all over. I wasn't sure how my screen was doing, so I peeled off the protector. My phone screen was completely fine! I went home and used a second screen protector that was in the package, because now I know this product is great since I've experienced it for myself. The protector did it's job, and I'm very happy. I'm only leaving three stars for the adhesion portion of this review simply because, while the screen protector adhered well, the lens covers did not.",

To give an example, I only write one small fact on a piece of paper. I use 6 sheets of paper. So very little writing. I purchased these markers in hopes that they would last longer. They’re lasting MUCH longer and they write beautifully. With the other markers, some times it was difficult to read what was written because it would bleed so much. These markers are great and write so clearly. I’m glad it wasn’t my handwriting that was the issue with the dollar tree ones. Ha!",

        "content": "I bought these for bullet journaling so I had access to more colors to add as accents for the brush pens I already own. I know some people try to use them as brunsh pen substitutes in themselves, but I don't recommend it with how quick the tip wears down.\n\nThe Pros:\n•They are so cheap. So. Cheap. They could be absolute garbage and only work for a day but honestly I would still recommend them for how cheap they are\n•Huge color variety! I did go to college for painting so I (not to toot my own horn) have a good eye for distinguishing color other folks might not. I appreciate having some colors that are close but one is warmer while the other is cooler, which does happen a bit.\n•The tips are, in fact, super! Very pointy to start out and the broad side is the perfect width perfect for highlighting. It is slightly thinner than the average 6cm dot grid found in most bullet journals\n•The back end of the marker is marked with the cap color, too, so you can't get the colors mixed up by putting the wrong cap on a marker\n•Surprisingly smudge resistant! Not smudge proof, but they don't smudge under other markers and they don't smudge pens more than expected (looking at you, Stabilo Boss) under them. They dry fast, so you also won't smudge them running your hand over them for the most part\n•They start out feeling very juicy, but not in a way that pools on the paper. You can get some good depth and variation in color in one stroke by varying pressure and speed.\n•Theyre buildable! Not blendable, but they dry quickly so can create 3 or so different shades without a problem on the paper (Rhodia 80gsm) I've been using\n\nCons (which I will again emphasize are sort of less relevant because these were $15 at my time of purchase and would have to be worse than garbage for me to not recommend):\n\n•The biggest one for me, honestly, is that I can't organize them in the box!! This might not bother other folks and some of you may have marker stands, but I don't and this bothers the hell out of me! They're kept in the box by four smaller boxes which fit two rows of 13/12 markers, which means there's tons of room for the markers to wiggle everywhere as you're taking them out and putting them back in. This matters especially because...\n•They are only visually marked by color, not with any number or label. I tried using a Permanent Pilot Twin Marker to label them after I put them in rainbow order, but they are slick and it rubbed off immediately\n•They wear down in time. I set aside a handful of markers each month as one months color palette for my bullet journal, and after one month, the colors I heavily relied on have lost their tip and don't have much \"endurance\" meaning I can write and draw with them, but it doesn't take much until they get less ink and I have to set them aside and wait a minute. None have completely dried out on me in the couple of months I've had them, though\n•There are no true pastels! Good on Crayola for making nice and saturated markers, but there isn't anything that serves as a gentle highlight I can use\n•There are, of course, still some gaps in the colors.\n•The caps are hard to post on the ends sometimes. None have cracked so far, but it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility\n•Not good to use with a water brush. They're surprisingly water resistant (which is generally a good thing!) So if you're looking for blendable markers you can carry with you for travel water color painting, they are not it\n•They will wear down so fast if you try to apply pressure and use them like a brush pen. Which is fine if that's what you're using them for! They still last enough to be worth it in my eyes. But after 3 or 4 uses you will find your upstrokes get thick and the bottom of your downstrokes don't have that nice deeper color.\n•It is hard to get a smooth color if you're actually coloring with them. This is a general complaint of most water based markers, though. They're really not mush worse than my expensive Tombows in that.\n\nAgain, though, my gripes are incredible overshadowed by how cheap they are. I gave them five starts not because they're perfect, but because they are so cheap they do not have to be.",

        "content": "I recently purchased the Hammermill Printer Paper and I am extremely happy with my purchase. The paper is a perfect weight for printing documents, at 20 lbs it is sturdy enough to withstand multiple prints without tearing or jamming in the printer. The 92 brightness makes the text and images on my documents look crisp and clear, and the 8.5 x 11 size fits perfectly in my printer.\n\nI also appreciate that this package includes 3 reams, which means I have a nice supply of paper on hand for all my printing needs. The price is also very reasonable for the quantity and quality of paper that you receive.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Hammermill Printer Paper to anyone in need of high-quality copy paper. It has exceeded my expectations and has become my go-to choice for all my printing needs.",

As far as this cleaner, I used it on all the surfaces of my car except for the leather. Cleaned the windows, mirrors, and the touchscreen well.

I've had a few of the metal hooks crack off but not many--mostly while moving or if I accidentally step on it/exert force the wrong way.

They are not as sturdy as quality wood hangers but take up much less profile space, so more clothes fit in the same space. Since the \"body\" of the hanger is covered with felt, clothes don't slide off and get misplaced in the bottom of the closet.\nI feel the only negative thing is that it is slightly difficult to take clothes off a hanger and much more difficult to put on a hanger.

With these, I can just turn the heads.\n\nOne thing, I don't like so much about them, is the felt like material that allows the clothes to be held onto the hanger, also makes it difficult to put a shirt on it.

There was a faint smell for a couple of minutes after taking the bag off, but that was it. I posted a picture here of what it looks like on my small to mid-size chair for comparison.\n\nThe cushion may seem firm at first, but after sitting on it for a while it will \"break in.\" I think anyone that is heavyset or has a very \"wide\" frame will probably be the ones to complain about this cushion.

The normal stretching, ice, heating etc. just wasn't cutting it as i was needing to sit for 8 hours a day. I came across this product and decided to give it a try. Since purchasing i have not regretted it once. As soon as I got the item i left it outside as suggested to air out and then started using it. Within 1 day i could feel the pressure relief within my back / tailbone and within a few days of using this product and doing the other mentioned remedies i was able to get back to normal. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who sits for 8+ hours a day and has minor-medium lower back/tailbone discomfort and pain\n\nPros\n- Very comfortable (soft enough to sit on, yet sturdy enough to still be firm)\n- stays in place and does not slide around in the seat of the chair\n\nCons\n- The only con is the foam smell, but that is pretty normal and does go away / lessen over time (especially if you allow it to air out as recommended)",

        "content": "Overall I do like this seat cushion but do have some issues. I needed a cushion for my office computer chair to make sitting long hours more comfortable. I do not have pain or back issues to deal with. What I found is that the cushion is great at first but after sitting for long hours it starts to flatten out. I have to get up and try and make it unflatten. So far it still has flattened out and not at its original depth and thickness. I left it overnight to see if it would conform to original size but it does not. So maybe my personal preference is that I want a high cushion that stays full and does not flatten, but maybe that is a wrong perception of a cushion. I have a memory foam pillow that I put underneath the cushion and this helps keep it work better by adding more thickness and depth. Well it works but I am not happy with the flattening out of the cushion. I keep it because yes it does its job but not as good as I thought it would. I am giving it a 4 star rating because my preference and expectations may be different from other buyers.",

It is thicker and more dense so it does not compress all the way down. It offers good support and has the perfect recess for the tail bone. My only complaint is that the front edge is square and after some time, you can feel that edge on the back of your legs. I would recommend the only improvement that could be made to this cushion would be to mold a \"waterfall\" edge to the front (rounded). Then I would give it 5 stars.",

        "content": "Dr Brown’s bottles, in general, are great!! Each one, however, is slightly different and overall I prefer the Options, even though my baby is not old enough to use valve-less. I have the original (terrible at spills, because the white cap in the shape of a top hat, sort of, doesn’t stop any liquid at all; they have clear bottles, blue tubies, and whitish valves). I have 4oz blue Options (great, easy parts, thumb print on the lid is awesome for popping that sucker off, and the lid also has these bumps that line up with the nipple, where it slows down the leaking of liquids, and keeps the leak in the cap, although given the ease of taking the cap off, it can still get really messy). (Sorry for the run on sentences, I’m a sleep deprived mama!!) I have the 4oz pink Options (similar to the blue, but actually the valve fits very snuggly along with the tubey part into the bottle, so that can be handy when trying to put the bottle together or add formula, while also holding a baby - more stable than any of the other bottles, where the tubey/valve pieces are just loose kind of sitting on top of the bottle; similar cap as the blue, but no thumb print, and harder to get the cap off, especially one handed). Lastly, I have the 8oz Options with plain bottles and with the Dream/Adventure and Animal characters, all with the green valves and tubies, and the similar cap to the blue, except they are clear, thumbprint included! These have been great, and the animal characters are super cute; the ‘dream big’ and ‘adventure awaits’ are cute-meh. The only thing I was disappointed in that set, is that half the bottles had characters, and half were plain. I may be off on the count, because I bought two sets, but I remember being bummed that I paid a premium for cuteness, and didn’t get a full set of cuteness! I do not own, but have used some purple wide bottles that I was loaned while traveling. That was great, so I wouldn’t have to carry a bunch of bottles, but I wouldn’t/didn’t buy them; they’re just too wide for my taste, harder to handle, especially one handed, and I didn’t feel the wide nipple was significantly better for my baby girl. I will address two of the main two complaints I’ve seen about Dr. Brown’s: leaking and too many parts to clean! Leaking, yes, totally a thing, but it does in fact say on the bottle to only fill to X line to avoid leaking! Having said that, it is very hard for my brain to perfectly calculate how much water I need for the formula, where I don’t end up exceeding the volume specified on ghe bottle! I personally don’t think it’s a huge issue. I know it’s going to or probably will, leak, given the liquid in the bottle, and what I do is to keep a cloth or bib under the bottle when she first starts drinking, and after the liquid is down a bit, I just open the bottle up and pull the valve/tubey piece up a bit, and several big drops come flying down the side of the bottle, which I just wipe off with the same bib/cloth. I can immediately get the bottle put back together before my daughter complains too terribly much. Remember, this is only an issue when you’re filling the entire bottle, either 4oz or 8, so at that point the baby is a bit older and can hopefully handle the briefest of pauses without too much of an issue. If my daughter were the type to go full on nuclear melt down, I think I would probably have to be more diligent about staying under the line, and offering more milk, once the bottle’s finished, and a fuller belly is less likely to melt down. Ok, regarding too many parts to clean... there’s what? Two extra parts that other bottles don’t have? Meh. But I will totally recommend getting the Dr Brown’s dishwasher baskets!!! Oh. Dude. Awesome sauce, life-saving, yes. I am very green, sustainable oreinted, so I cringe at how much water I’m consuming running the dishwasher sometimes every day. So not cool. And, I’m also a sole parent, so I gots a lot to take care of, dishwashy basket is a must!! I have 4. : 0 ) I’m not a super fan of washing the nipples in the dishwasher, so I still do those by hand, no biggy. There’s even special baskets for just nipples; someone gave them to me, but no, I no likey since it looks like there’s still a film on the inside.\nMy experience with Dr Brown’s bottles in general, has been awesome! I don’t even remember when I sorta stopped burping my baby (she’s six months now), it just happened organically over time, but when I was burping her (maybe for three months?), she would only have one, maybe two burps. She burps on her own now, but then maybe that’s just her, the point is that there was very little gas! She had a wee bit of reflux as a newborn, but that’s normal I think, what with having an immature gut as a tadpole-baby. I gave her probiotics and kept her upright-ish, and I think the bottles helped. Ultimately, I totally recommend them!! They were recommended to me by my sister, 8 years ago, as my nephew’s salvation, hope they work for you!",

My twins never suffered from colic or has problems sucking from the bottle. As my boys got bigger, I would just change the nipples. They even sell a nipple to help them get started on sippy cups, which works. I highly recommend this brand for new moms and moms that are looking for the perfect bottle.",

One came off easily, the other took 20 min and a screwdriver (and preying I didn't break them. My hands hurt so bad. I had to use leather gloves to pull and push on the sharp metal parts.\n\nThen there was actually figuring out how to get it on the hook. I got there eventually but I think I spent 45 min on all this! Now that they're on they are working way better than my old warped set. I still see a dash of streaking but it goes away almost immediately. Hopefully won't be a big deal.\n\nHot tip: before you throw away your old wipers, swipe the squeegee down with rubbing alcohol over and over until the cloth becomes clean. So much gunk will come off and they'll work way better. The gunk adds to the streaks.",

But I keep it in her mouth until she’s ready to drink again, because she’s still hungry even if she’s grumpy.

Each automatic grinder uses 6 AAA batteries. I don't mind that at all. More power to grind with. I set the both of them down to the finest setting and I'm using them for happy belly black peppercorns (fantastic by the way) and my Colimo sea salt. They are working great for both. I had traditional grinders that were very nice but during a recent arthritis and gout flare up in my hand, I was totally unable to use them because my hand was in fact was useless. These automatic grinders solve that problem. As long as I have one hand that I'm able to use, I'm golden because these are fully automatic and begin to grind as soon as you turn them upside down. The light turns on and it starts grinding. As soon as you you turn it upright again, it stops... Genius. I love them so far. I will update after several months of daily use. The glass containers hold a nice amount of peppercorns, salt or spices! The LED light is kind of pointless and it's blue which is really weird but I don't hold it against these because they work so great! 😊 👍",

It is pretty obvious whoever thought these high beam headlights were a good idea, never actually used them on food.\n\nBetween the color of the light, and the intensity level, it's nearly impossible to actually see the amount of pepper you're applying.\n\nGeneral aviation airplane landing light - yes.\nS&P grinder light - no.\n\nOther than the mild sunburn I get from them each time I use them, I love everything else about them.\n\nI'm pretty savvy with small electronics. I will be disassembling these to deactivate the lights. They're really not needed.",

Great to have and use without taking up 2 hands to manually grind.

However, it grinds our pepper relatively slow. At first we thought maybe the shakers were specific to salt and pepper and we had them backwards but we swapped the containers and got the same result. Either way, not a deal breaker. We'll keep the grinders but just have to be aware of the difference when using them.",

It’s easy to install, ( make sure you use a pressure regulator when using it ) you hook it up to water source, let the water run till it’s no longer black water ( from the charcoal inside the filter) then hook up to your rv , boat , etc.\nI will say the water tastes amazing ! However, your filter won’t last long if it’s the only source for your faucet, shower & toilet, so be sure to keep this in mind . I used it for our city water hook up. The water wasn’t bad before the filter, I could drink as is, but I wanted to see if it made any difference & it did. Also, and here’s why I call it a double edge sword, once the filter is used up, it puts out a nasty, vial taste and smell in your water ! I guess that’s their alert for you need to replace your filter ? I took the filter off and did not replace it and the water was no longer nasty & vial. I’m sure in places where the water is disgusting , it would make a big difference. I will most likely keep one on hand for that sole purpose when ever I’m traveling. What I think would be more helpful, is if they made filters that hooked on to your kitchen faucets. That way you aren’t wasting filtered water on flushing the toilet or shower.",

I also worried about giving it to my dogs to drink. The installation was a breeze but there were no instructions that mentioned the black water that comes out at first. I was alarmed but I found their website and read that it’s carbon from the filter and it isn’t harmful. I made my first pot of coffee this morning (without my regular dread) and it was far better than regular tap water! The only thing that I don’t like is that it leaked from the water source.

I love this pencil so much and I can’t stop raving about it. No wonder it has over 80k reviews!!!! A friend of mine gifted me an Apple Pencil earlier this week. Upon further inspection, it was a first gen pencil and I need a second gen pencil. I couldn’t exchange it because he didn’t get it at the Apple Store (I think he got it on the Zon, lol) so I sold it to a friend of mine for $80. New one was 100 so she got a discount, and I can use the money toward the pencil that was compatible with my iPad. You know what? I’m seriously debating going to Apple and getting it. This pen works pretty awesomely for me. I think I’ll just keep what I have.\n\nGreat gift too!! I love it.",

Super easy to connect and it automatically connects every time. Sometimes it does turn off but all you have to do it tap the top it’s very easy. I bought a case for the iPad that has a holder and it fits great. Only wish is that it showed battery percentage somewhere. I’ve charged it a few times and it’s never died but I don’t known how long the charge lasts for. Not a big problem though. Highly recommend as an amazing Apple Pencil dupe.",

You get unlimited colors. To sum up what I’m trying to say, is buy this pen if you are the artistic type or just want to write with a pen.

        "content": "I've bought many of these screen protectors, and you probably have too if you've been using cell phones for a while. They shouldn't be super complicated to make, but some are better than others. JETtech has been among the most reliable, in my experience. It's important that they give you more than 2, because while installation isn't difficult, I've found no perfect way to ensure that zero specks of dust attach to the phone screen or the sticky side just before you pop the protector on the phone. It can happen. Usually the bubbles that they form will come out in a day or two, but if you can't live with the result, it's important to have a backup and still one left over when you need to replace it.\n\nAs for the \"tempered glass\" part, I don't know whether any of these brands really has tempered glass in them; they all feel like thin plastic to me. But they do help to protect against scratches and cracks. I have a good case on my iPhone and have dropped it many times, even screen side down, and the combination of the case edges (which extend beyond the phone) and the screen protectors almost always holds. Sometimes the screen protector gets faint cracks in it not long after installation, but only if I've dropped it hard. I figure the cracks are in the screen protector rather than my phone screen, so while I need to replace the protector, it's a small price to pay.\n\nJETtech is one of my go-to brands.",

        "content": "*****Update-Feb 8th, 2023****\nBefore editing this review again, I was thinking, \"How can I find a single element that adequately expresses all aspects of a phone mount?\"\n\nApproximately 3 years ago, after having the pleasure of contacting VANMASS customer service about the suction cup temperature issue, I determined that their customer service goes above and beyond any other offered by an internet-based company.\n\nUsually, when purchasing an item the transaction is over after I can use it as expected and the seller has resolved all my issues. But what I didn't expect was that when I returned to the office back from my Xmas break in 2023 I received an email from a VANMASS wishing me a happy new year and wanting to know how the product was performing now.\n\nThe 36-month warranty offered by VANMASS is more than a simple guarantee. No matter how much time has passed they still consider the needs and feelings of each customer. These guys have again renewed my belief in humanity with their over-the-top customer service.\n\nTo the initial query, I believe I have an answer, and that factor is the CERTIFICATION OF TIME. Although the Amazon marketplace is sophisticated, the mission of the phone mount is simple - to make driving easy. This mount has done that for the past 3 years, and I think it will do so well beyond that given its high quality of it.\n\nI travel quite frequently with my kids and love to go on adventures with them. Each year we prepare a list of places and people we wish to visit that year. Now that the world has opened up again and the once-sleepy cities have long since been awakened it's time to get out into the world again.\n\nWe traveled through numerous cities with this car mount, ensuring that we can reach where we need to be. When it's cool outside I'll use the suction cup and when it's hot I'll move the mount to the vents. Either way, you can use the holder to hold your phone as it charges while also allowing it to navigate. This not only ensures safe driving but also consistently saves us money on expensive gasoline\n\nUltimate success in life is created by day-to-day persistence, a process that is often tedious, repetitive, and requires patience. The same experience that this product has undergone allows it to continue to exist today. It is unique but only because it has gone through a long period of improvement.\n\nLastly, I discovered that they had added more colors. Among them is purple, my daughter's favorite color, I didn't hesitate to get one then because I had no idea that any company even made a purple phone holder. When it arrived, my daughter couldn't wait to open the box because she was excited to have a mount that would match her purple outfit lol. The mount looked as adorable as she did.\n\nIf you are looking for a phone mount that can be installed on the dashboard, windshield, or air vent to free your hands and bring convenience to your driving, you can trust VANMASS. They are very professional with their service and their products are reliable.\n\n******Original review******\nI was conquered by VANMASS! If you told one customer service of a car mount company that every time you finish eating Mexican food, your car mount will be fall off, so you want a refund, what should the customers service do? VANMASS gave us the right answer, they communicate with me over 10 emails, finially solved the issue.\nI have to say that the moment I got VANMASS I was very satisfied. The package is very simple and elegent. You can tell it is not the same thing as the $5 car mount on the market. The product is an artwork, the cutting is neat, all parts are complete, and the installation is very easy. At first, there was no issue at all, then something strange happened.\nThere are two Mexican restaurants not far from my company, I picked up my lunch there sometimes. The strange thing is that every time I come back from Serrano's, my car mount will fall off, and then I need to clean the suction cup and re-attach them to the dashboard. But I didn't encounter this problem when I came out of another Mexican restaurant. I put the car in the same parking lot, it is so frustrating.\nI contacted VANMASS for warranty, I think VANMASS is a little wronged though. This kind of thing keeps happening, it is really frustrating. I did not not expect that, the customer service of VANMASS, reply me immediately, and did not think it was a spoof.\nAfter she got the details, she asked a question about how long I usually stay in Serrano's. Then I understood the problem. Serrano's business is better than the other restaurant in near street. It took me about one hour to finish my lunch at Serrano's instead half-hour at others.\nCustomer service told me that when the temperature outside the car is 100 ℉， after half an hour, the temperature inside the car is about 130℉, after one hour, 150℉. The car mount fall out because of the temperature growth rapidly.\nFrom then on, I would insert the car mount into the the vent or park the car in the shade during the hot weathers, no matter which Mexican restaurant I went to, I never encountered this problem again, lol\nI am very grateful to the customer service of VANMASS for helping me solve the problem. I truly feel that VANMASS is professional and responsible, the reply is timely and not perfunctory. In short, VANMASS is a brand I CAN TRUST! Best shopping experience on Amazon.",

I rarely ever write reviews, but they deserved to be acknowledged. You won't regret buying from them.",

Upon initial search thought I might have to purchase a 6-foot folding table which was really too big for my needs. This 48\" table is the perfect size. Am considering ordering several more as I figure out how best to arrange my workspace. The medium size offers great flexibility in this regard. Table can be used as a standalone, or side by side (48\" sides matching), or end-to-end, or perpendicular (on either end), or T-shaped configuration, or flush against a wall--all without taking up too much space. No tools required for assembly/setup. But it was very disappointing that there are no instructions. Lots of print copy on the packing box, as well as images. Seems that it would be a simple thing for manufacturer to print the instructions on the packing box, along with all of the other words on the box (which has plenty of surface space to include the instructions). Perhaps manufacturer doesn't want to incur the cost of a printed set of instructions on a single sheet inside the box. Called Customer Service which was responsive. Customer Service Rep said they get numerous calls about the absence of any written instructions, but she sort of walked me through it, and invited a callback, if I was unable to get the table set up. Good price. Shipping is extra cost factor. Use will be primarily indoors in an extended home office type setting where tabletop surface is needed for some of the office equipment (desktop CPU & dual monitors, etc.) and space needed to spread out papers and files.",

While it is easy to make the heights different, it does take a bit of finger strength to push the buttons in to allow the legs to move up or down. But that is good because then you do not have to worry about the tables legs dropping on you when you put stuff on it. I really like using this table so much so that I have a total of 4 of them. They hold up really well and can withstand a bit of weight. I use my tables for painting, scrapbooking and any time I need a larger area to do crafting on. Then when I am finished with whatever I was doing, I just lower the legs, fold it in half and sit it in a closet out of the way. I also like the fact that if you need to put it in a car, it does not take up a lot of space.",

I love that. Of course, at the tallest height it gets a little less sturdy. The next height down is plenty sturdy, not to stand on and dance drunk or anything, just enough to do some work on it or feed some children, have a lemonade stand, put your Replica Surfaces on it, set out a food spread while tailgating, a buffet for a party, that kind of thing.\n\nIt's a great price.\n\nThat said,",

In fact, it's all we used for a budget desk solution at the startup I used to work for, so I was confident in buying one for home.

        "content": "Update: September 2017\nAnother great use for these tables: When painting or installing decorative shutters on the house these tables at their highest setting make a great temporary workbench to use outside for all of your needed tools. I found this lightweight table very handy for setting drills, screws, etc. when I installed plywood on my window before hurricane Irma hit Florida.\nI have a bad back so using the table reduced the need for me to bend down to pick up tools, etc. The tables are easy to move. I found it easy to pick one up (makeshift crossbar and all) and lift it over my head with the legs aiming to the sky then rest the table top on my head while I walked it to the place in my yard where I needed it. I'm no muscle man. I'm a 6 foot, overweight 64 year old but I could easily handle putting the table top on my head. (I know. Bad visual. That's why there is no picture of me doing this! LOL.)\nORIGINAL POSTING:\nI'm reviewing Lifetime Table 4428 with the folding table top.\nPros:\nThis table has 4 features that are hard to find in one table: a folding table top, 36\" height, small footprint for storage and a decent price.\nGood height as an outfeed table for my 7491RS table saw.\nHighest height 36\" is perfect for projects where you want to stand.\nFolds up for storage.\nCarrying strap.\nNot too heavy for short distance carrying for a 62 yr. old male.\nThis is a great table for a 'weekend woodworker' who needs to store everything away at the end of the project so his car will fit in the garage again!\nCons:\nOnly 24\" wide.\nSurface has a slight texture but writing with a gel pen and paper are no problem.\nNot contractor quality nor durability but good for many home uses.\nNot for heavy items like engines. Not a sturdy workbench.\nNot easy to open for a weak/elderly person.\nTricky to open and close but this technique should help:\nPull it out of the box, stand it on end and place the hinge side on the floor.\nUse a large screwdriver to pry open the end opposite the hinge. Reason being the plastic clip holding it closed is very tight until it wears a little.\nOnce opened, tip the table on its side edge and extend the table top and legs until they lock.\nLook for one red plastic clip under the table surface near the hinges. Press it to lock the table top open.\nNow stand the table on its legs. It will be real low.\nTo raise the table you need 3 arms, 2 people or this trick:\nPut your foot on the cross bar that connects 2 legs to each other.\nPress in on the 2 silver pins that pop out of the side of the legs and at the same time push down with your foot while lifting with your hands. The table will rise one level.\nDo the same thing to the other end of the table.\nRepeat the process until you achieve the desired height. There are 3 ht. settings.\n====================\nAnother con: The table wobbles side to side at the highest setting but I have a simple cure to make it sturdy:\nBuy a cheap 2x2 stick of lumber for a couple bucks. Actual dimensions: 1.5\"x1.5\"x4ft.\nCut a notch in the center of each end of the stick to these dimensions: 1\" deep by 1\" wide. I used a scroll saw.\nWith the table at its highest setting, pressure fit diagonally the notches between the 2 cross bars at ground level. Then slide/center the stick perpendicular to the cross bars. No screws or bolts needed. The stick will force the legs apart and reduce the wobbling. If you are unable to cut notches in the stick you might get by just using a 47\" stick. See photo of notched stick.",

I belived the Scotch Thermal Laminator would lend some credibility to our youth movement. I also believed that despite being made fun of and tormented by the youth, they would realize that we take our beliefs seriously and took the time to laminate our literature.\n\nSince we normally travel in pairs, we always want to present the same professional image and therfore wear ties. Here's a hint - ties and lamination machines do not mix. The lighting is subpar in our temple so I had to lean over the Scotch Thermal Laminator to ensure it was hot enought to use. It was! When I leaned over, my tie was accidentally fed into the insertion slot and pulled me into it! I'm natuarally a panicky soul, at least according to the Father, and I didn't know what to do. My tie was being fed into the machine and my face was getting closer. In fact, I could smell my first beard attempt starting to singe! Thankfully Jebidiaha saw what was happening and simply unplugged the Scotch Thermal Laminator. Sadly, our bikes were stolen from out front while this was happening, but at least we got our brochures laminated and distributed even if it was on foot.\n\nI would buy this again. In fact I WILL repurchase this same Scotch Thermal Laminator model once our headquarters wires us our monthly stipend. My only real complaint is that the machine doesn't have a reverse button. :)",

Amazon offered a few other models at somewhat lower prices, but I decided to spend the extra few dollars on the name brand Scotch. Very glad that I did.\n\nDevice heats up reasonably quickly (just a few minutes time). Feeder works flawlessly. Laminations of small and large size (business card size, letter paper size) feed easily and the laminated sheets look professionally done - no gaps, bubbles, or creases.\n\nNow that I have such a device, I'm finding quite a few uses for it. Very pleased with this purchase.",

        "content": "I bought this product when I recently replaced my toaster oven and discovered that every toaster oven on the market now has a super short cord. I liked that this device would cover the outlet and provide that extra length needed for the new toaster oven. However, it is NOT perfect.\n\nPros:\n- Outlet cover does cover the entire outlet with a minimally flat cover\n- Cord is rated for 1625 watts, which will support small kitchen appliances with heating elements like toaster ovens, coffee pots, electric tea kettle, etc.\n- I like that I have 3 outlets now instead of my original 2\n\nCons:\n- The cord management kit that comes with the unit is useless. The adhesive backings pull off as soon as you put any tension on it (e.g. attaching the cord to the clip). I followed the instructions to the letter. I thoroughly cleaned the surfaces, dried them, and then cleaned them again with alcohol and let thoroughly dry before adhering the clips. I then let them sit for over an hour (instructions say 15 mins). As soon as I attached the cord, the clips pulled off the surface. I did this exercise again, this time letting them sit >24 hours after cleaning. Same results. It should be noted that I was trying to adhere the clips to a tiled backsplash and a granite counter. The strips to adhere the outlet end of the cord were just as bad. I ended up using industrial strength velcro for that.\n- The outlet cover does not sit flush against the outlet/wall. There is a noticeable gap between the cover and the outlet. Not a huge deal, but far from ideal.\n- The outlet cover is MUCH larger than I anticipated. I would have preferred an outlet cover that was the same size as the original outlet plate (possibly even replacing the plate), as that would have made it even more sleek and slim.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n- in addition to a smaller outlet cover as previously mentioned, I would also have liked to see a couple of USB ports along with the 3 outlets - especially in this day and age where everyone has to charge their devices\n\nConclusion:\nIt solved my problem, but it is not perfect and it is VERY expensive for what you are getting. Unfortunately, this manufacturer seems to be the only game in town with an extension cord that provides a full flat cover over the original outlet. It's too bad it is lacking features (USB plugs), and it definitely could use some quality improvements for the pricetag.",

Mine are sticking perfectly. Nothing really to install just plug it in and put on the little cord stickers and done.

Mine is in an outlet for my TV, clock, fireplace, and added an adaptor for my firestick. It is all hidden behind my fireplace TV stand. Yeah-yah!

Canon realized this dream in 1936 when it released the Hansa Canon, Japan's first 35mm focal-plane shutter camera. Since that time, our technological strengths have helped us to also become a digital imaging and networking company and a force in personal and office printers, copiers, controllers and fax machines. We also have applied our innovative skills in environmental technologies, as well as medical, semiconductor, and broadcasting equipment. We will continue to develop innovative technologies as a means of bettering the world we live in - redefining the workplace and enhancing lifestyles.\n\nAs always, Canon aims to be a good corporate citizen within the community and will continue fostering relationships in the surrounding area.",

I printed off photos that I used as Christmas presents for friends using photos paper of excellent quality, and the photos came out to be perfect. I was very pleased with the quality of the printing at least partially due to this ink cartridge, so absolutely no complaints. It has not run out so I can't speak to longevity actually although indications by the gauge on my printer are that it is doing just fine....at least as expected. Update...it sure seems like it could have lasted longer. Ran out rather quickly. So rating should be adjusted maybe to a 4 star.",
